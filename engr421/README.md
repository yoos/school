# ENGR421: Applied Robotics

This directory houses all code related to the Applied Robotics class taken
Spring term 2013.

* B11: USART3 RX

TODO: Finish the list above


## Useful references

* STM32F4 datasheet

## Thoughts and todo's

Use a permanent magnet to pull BBs faster into firing chamber? The magnet
should be weak enough that once the BB is grabbed by the wheel, it should
easily break away.

Do system ID on shooter flywheel to determine optimal BB contact time in
chamber.

Get some magnet wire from Rugh's.

Capture some videos of BBs traveling at 10 ft/s with PS3Eye cameras.

SIFT, then use a matcher like FLANN.
