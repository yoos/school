## Thoughts and todo's

Use a permanent magnet to pull BBs faster into firing chamber? The magnet
should be weak enough that once the BB is grabbed by the wheel, it should
easily break away.

Do system ID on shooter flywheel to determine optimal BB contact time in
chamber.

Get some magnet wire from Rugh's.
