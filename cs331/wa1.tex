\section*{Written Assignment \#1}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Performance Measure: Cheapest, usable condition, fast
						shipping, good customer service
					\item Environment: Vendors, other buyers
					\item Actuators: Capability of crawling the web
					\item Sensors: Capability of parsing web pages
				\end{itemize}
			\item
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Partially observable (cannot see all of the Internet
						at once)
					\item Strategic (other buyers are making purchases at
						unknown times)
					\item Sequential (a decision to reconsider a listing later
						may result in the item being sold to another buyer)
					\item Dynamic (the Internet is always changing)
					\item Continuous (purchases can be made at any time)
					\item Single agent (although there are other buyers, we are
						dealing with only a single agent we can control)
				\end{itemize}
			\item A utility-based agent would be most appropriate here.
				A simple reflex agent will be unable to compare all available
				deals. A model-based reflex agent may be able to find available
				deals but be unable to pick out the best. A goal-based agent is
				not useful in determining the best deal (it may be useful in
				finding the deals, but that is not the focus here).
				A utility-based agent will be able to weigh the different
				performance measures and decide on the best deal, which may or
				may not maximize any one of the performance measures but result
				in an overall ``happiest'' state.
