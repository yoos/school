there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of scream queen in the early 80s two of them were halloween movies but the other two prom night and terror train were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween the same god im scared theres some guy in a mask coming after me routine she did in john carpenters classic jamie lee copies here with none of the urgency or suspense terror train takes place on where else a train charted by some premed students finishing their first four years of higher education most of them wont make it to med school though and its obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains i wish to hell theyd put a radio on that train the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone even jamie lee from the beginning hes talking his head off he tells one of his coworkers think on this whens the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station as if it makes any kind of sense and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles of course the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it i forgot to mention the prologue its a party three years earlier with the same group of students two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge promising him hes going to get laid they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in noticing a form on the bed she says kiss me kenny and he kisses the body on the bed which happens to be a cadaver oh my god they killed kenny you bastards its a sick trick and one jamie lee wasnt let in on she still hasnt forgiven the guy as they board the terror train you asshole you cant have a good time without hurting somebody the killing starts before the train even leaves the station since its new years everyones wearing disguises a convenient plot device weve seen before and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no ones looking at least one of the characters says its a groucho mask when the killer dons it and steps aboard it looks like gene shalit who by the way would make a great killer in a slasher movie speaking of weirdlooking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene one of terror trains most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield as the magician who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music then theres his greatest trick getting laid with hair that looks like that for all its attempts at visual style and substance terror train is more lionel than amtrak more prom night than halloween and nothing really worth watching only diehard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield if he truly has any fans should even attempt to watch it and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse i mean when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station anyway terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car 
according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers isolated motels diners gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers at the beginning of eye of the storm 1991 german american thriller directed by yuri zeltser one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up ten years later their son steven played by bradley gregg who was blinded during the incident still runs motel together with his older brother ray played by craig sheffer hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone played by dennis hopper gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra played by lara flynn boyle their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed yuri zeltser author of this film was obviously inspired by hitchcocks psycho but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot instead of norman bates we have two brothers one of them traumatised physically another mentally sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere the acting is fine hopper gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine unfortunately eye of the storm which was supposed to be intense psychological drama deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale in the end this film reminds us that original approach cant prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities special note to the profiler fans ally walker appears in the beginning of the film in the small role of killers girlfriend 
if youve been following william fichtners career and theres absolutely no reason why you should have you might have noticed that hes played some rather similar roles over the years like sully in the perfect storm tough gruff and a little bit scary or law in albino alligator tough gruff and little bit scarier or colonel william sharp in armageddon or dwayne engelman in strange days or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of pearl harbor as the abusive father of dannyhere is an actor who gravitates towards tough gruff hardhitting roles which is why his performance in whats the worst that could happen is such a shock such a delight in the film fichtner plays a blonde haired meticulously dressed overtly effeminate dogloving detective as alex tardio fichtners performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it it borders on offensive but doesnt really manage it and it borders on clich d stereotype but doesnt quite succumb to that definition either in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming fichtner isnt perfectyou can see him struggling a little at times concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personalbut hes pretty damned good and silly and without question the best thing in the film in fact had it not been for fitchners sudden and bizarre appearance and his jarring screen presence thereafter i would have walked out for whats the worst that could happen is mesmerizing in its awfulness a poorly written haphazardly edited and totally unfunny yes it stars martin lawrence and danny devito so how could that be possible moviegoing experience fichtners performance doesnt exactly save the film and its not like im recommending whats the worst that could happen solely on the strength of the actors dramatic turnaround but his contributions do raise the films rating from no stars to oneandahalf thumbs up to fichtner then and thumbs downway way downto everyone else involved in this sorry mess a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesnt even warrant discussion 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned its rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature film dream with the fishes when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectations however are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the films latter half the films central characters are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nick lives in the apartment building across from terry who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terrys wristwatch and eventually cons terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pills of course terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch learning of nicks condition he only has a handful of weeks left terrys compassion kicks in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies and nick will fulfill terrys death wish by killing him this is a promising premise and mr taylors film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters terry is a repessed mournful character who wants to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits and where the straightlaced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character this is bythenumbers plotting buddy movieroad movie redux however dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline but by the characters which carry the story it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits far from a romp this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond mr taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived witness such lines as you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see thats provocative leaves room for further questions the film enjoys a few inspired moments the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes this occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital im realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lips which is probably due to the obvious fact that its painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering freshfaced characters he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming with sharks who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry mr taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated as opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scenes the charge of dream with the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters and indeed in many cases have i been in the minority supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult audienceunfriendly nature of their characters for dream with the fishes though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die 
for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various lives he affects but while the characters places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars then he returns home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their fiveyearold daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies and his paranoid delusions early on when he accuses valeries brother billy charlie creedmiles of stealing raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to a bloody wreck but these are the least of billys problems billy is a heroin addict on the downturn and it doesnt seem that hell last much longer billy and valeries mother janet laila morse is raymonds nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it she merely struggles on hoping her children will survive their respective torments if this description seems bleak i havent told the half of it this is not a cheery movie and most of the time its downright depressing while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him in the end its not quite worth it there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy the film is filled with these character moments that never really achieve anything granted there are a few genuinely powerful and sickening moments in the film but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us the actors do a fine job particularly in the central roles the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that theres no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience oldman got it about half right 
my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one but in fact the third installment it was the first to gain a national theatrical release i didnt see the first film until much later so looking back the original didnt hold a lot of great memories for me since i didnt think too much of it when i initially saw it watching it now for a second time confirmed that its an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever you all know the story by now child murderer freddy krueger robert englund returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before this first installment does an adequate job with its low budget but theres some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story plus the movies ending understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a hook for a sequel renders the rest of the film pointless and does anyone understand what happens to nancys mother at the end of this film dont get me wrong though its not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly and a nightmare on elm street just doesnt cut it a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set the film is presented in both pan and scan and its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 78 1 although on the disc that comes in the box set only a widescreen transfer is provided the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 1 mix also included on the dvd is a fulllength audio commentary track with writerdirector wes craven stars john saxon and heather langenkamp and the films director of photography other extras include the jump to a nightmare feature im sure you can figure that one out the usual cast and crew bios which are from the films original press release kit and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp and the films original theatrical trailer some dvdrom features are also included but since i dont have dvdrom capabilities i cant really get into that the commentary track is entertaining and informative but nothing spectacular the first thing of note is that its the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago im not saying thats a negative thing just pointing it out everyone seems enthusiastic about being there with the possible exception of john saxon who just doesnt say much at all most of the time youll forget hes even there everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason as if because theyre commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film however you can only access one easily the other is hidden in whats called the labyrinth which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created basically its an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage interviews etc somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film finding it though is both a chore and a bore r 
in 1989 tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather was it deep nope however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman pictures which was true if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic mans escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place if those films were tom sawyer then batman was huckleberry finn some critics glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it was something special mr lovell gave it 12 and wrote that this is batman as batman should be mr travers called it one of the ten best films of the year the praise was deserved from start to finish the film was enthralling exciting and superb in every respect there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes the villains the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batmans nose he simply gets mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batmans body she gets pushed off a building i admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is a mess nothing works out as planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast alas these are only hints there are dont misunderstand me several moments of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within a giant cage a small basket is dropped into a large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis a weak followup both career and sequel wise batman returns is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing 
and i thought stigmata would be the worst religiouslyoriented thriller released this year turns out i was wrong because while stigmata was merely boring and selfimportant end of days is completely inept on all fronts its a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best its extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesnt count is no fun at all end of days is a major stinker the movie opens in vatican city 1979 some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 1999 the world will be destroyed the pope orders protection of this girl though some priests believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty years later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal excop with a drinking problem now working as a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her there are so many problems with this film its hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions in other words trying to give him dimension was a mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role theyve all played noble and flawed heroes but not schwarzenegger there are several scenes that attempt to establish jerichos character one has him contemplating suicide another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christines location by offering him his old life back none of these scenes really work because arnie isnt up to the task the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before this one isnt at all believable the way arnold plays him the supporting cast tries their hardest and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all as the prince of darkness hes suave and confident he acts like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him as a powerful villain byrne outperforms arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrnes speech about the bible being overrated actually starts to make sense mainly because arnolds attempts at refuting it mostly of the tis not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold has to win so in the end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides but like most bad action movie sidekicks he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isnt given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting players are good actors but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performances aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which starts off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is its utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new years eve 1999 because its exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil which isnt 666 it turns out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is 999 so just add a 1 to the beginning and youve got 1999 if you dont buy this explanation youre not alone its convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous shes christine see and she lives in new york see and if that werent bad enough theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk excop hes powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he cant control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but its never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldnt matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean dont get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of days complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there it gets so formulaic that its possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a boo will come their predictions will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless partially because we dont care about these characters due to the scripts pathetic attempts at characterization and setup and also because they too dont make any sense theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady its good for a few chuckles but not much else supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never sets that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequences are so badly framed that its often hard to tell why its happening in the first place not to mention that theyre edited in fullon incomprehensible mtv quickcut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of days is not only silly and confusing but its also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesnt operate in the more subtle illconvincepeopletokilleachother fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesnt only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also means that not a single scene in end of days goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb scenes arent connected through any reasonable means so a lot of the time stuff gets blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why reasons to hell with reasons lets just blow stuff up isnt it cool nope not by a long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable its dull interminable and unrelenting in its stupidity perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career because its not happening with hack peter hyams here end of days might have had camp value if only it didnt top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobodys going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script if its going to be campy arnold shouldnt be taking himself so damn seriously i didnt actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldnt be such a sad sack as it stands end of days is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that 
stephen please post if appropriate mafia crime isnt a funny business by homer yen c 1998 on a particular night when i found myself having some free time i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia a spoof of mafia and crime films such as the godfather goodfellas and casino at 84 minutes in length i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep but by my account i think that my laffometer only registered a few grins one giggle and maybe one chortle i suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridges who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film mafia chronicles vincenzo cortinos lloyd bridges life separated from his family when he was young he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life but as fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord following in his footsteps are his two sons joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr like all siblings in powerful crime families they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and women mafia is cowritten by jim abrahams who also contributed to some gutbusting funny spoofs such as airplane and the naked gun but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work as i write this i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence its a tough genre to parody i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say please as they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity was never explored there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughterinlaw a gunman shoots him several times the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena i think that i just gave away the best part of the film oh well that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier 
die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the films pathetic screenplay every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land the film has zero credibility and all of the characters come off as cliched cardboard cutouts so much for the script how about the action well lets put it this way director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan who directed the original as well as the hunt for red october and predatorall standouts for their hairraising suspense by contrast harlin doesnt have a clue when it comes to choreographing action and consequently die hard 2 never picks up steam die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad its good you do laugh but you laugh at the film not with it die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff 
i admit it i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies watching him in jingle all the way i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg13 kindergarten cop but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence alcohol consumption burglary racism and child molestation and you know theyll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santas elves he later decks a reindeer hey man why dont you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while youre at it jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass it must be funny school of thought arnold sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents cant find a rare toy on christmas eve and will do anything to get one arnold is of course one of the parents a crack salesman who is never there for his son he races from the office to his sons karate game only to find out he missed it and his kid distrusts him because hes never around gee we havent seen that in a movie before arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his sons affection is to get him a turboman doll which his wife rita wilson who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this told him to get weeks ago so arnold sets out to find a turboman which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out let me back up for a minute here arnolds kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character which is unhealthy beyond belief watches the show eats the cereal sleeps on the freakin turboman sheets id try to discourage any further obsession myself lest any kid seeing this movie think its a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want but nooooo the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son who dont recognize him until the last minute this is a sad movie all the way through but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa jim belushi who runs a bootleg toy factory most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay an embarrassed martin mull who said he was giving away a turboman doll capitalism has produced some pretty evil things chia pets but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping your cookies are incredible its the main plot of the movie that sends the message that its okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want maybe thats what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house but not at mine 
when the haunting arrived in theaters all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department i dont think that they are completely to blame for this movies failure it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terrors and it was about as scary as a dust bunny so special effects or not if the story isnt the least bit scary you arent going to end up with a very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie as i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effects i kept wishing that this movie was about derns caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goingson catherine zetajones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects like the original taylors character is the star of the movie but since she doesnt quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms zetajones their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original and lets face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zetajones ill admit that i would have never seen this thing if she werent in it but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients there really isnt much of a story here just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with and the special effects are great in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shots quota at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when i first saw the house i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these rooms play in the story absolutely none they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie then we have the actors lili taylor has never been one of my favorites and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she comes in around the average or slightly below mark i have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman zetajones was cast because she is too hot for words the fact that her character is bisexual is just icing on the cake all catherine has to do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she does very well while she does have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eyecandy its too bad someone of her talents wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999s horror movies the blair witch project the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film if the story sucks its all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effects go rent star wars if its scares you want rent halloween either way its probably in your best interests to skip the haunting 
plot set in the future a courier has uploaded some data into a hard drive that resides in his head and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information since he overloaded his hard drive hes also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him critique incoherent boring oneact drivel with no suspense horribly unbelievable futuristic environment bad dialogue careerdefining bad acting by keanu reeves and a hilarious ending its too bad because the premise of the film was interesting but unfortunately for my friends and i this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us its one of those films that makes you start laughing halfway through when you realize that most of the actors in it suck the location shots are filmed in dark junkyard type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic whatever and all the sets look like well sets there is also absolutely no arc to this story it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings gibson should stick to writing novels and xfiles episodes since his segue into the paranormal tv series was much more entertaining than any of this garbage some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass henry rollins as a pumpedup cyberdoctor or something and icet as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face dont ask the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghostlady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point im ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal canada but sadly enough for us all it was some of the cybertravelling special effects were okay hence the 210 but overall its one of those bad movies thats just funny to watch and cringe at thankfully for keanu he redeemed his scifi career with 1999s the matrix 7 510 its too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent little known facts about this film and its stars as of 1999 director robert longo never directed another fullfeature film hmmm now isnt that odd writer william gibson immigrated from the us to canada in 1968 after being rejected for the draft he lived in toronto at first but since 1972 has made vancouver his home his 1984 novel neuromancer and its sequels 1986s count zero and 1988s mona lisa overdrive are generally considered to be the definitive works of the cyberpunk sciencefiction subgenre this film garnered keanu reeves a nomination in the worst actor category in the 1996 razzie awards 
i am a steven seagal fan i only say this now because mufti splenetik isnt my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones which well always hear when seagal does his limbtwisting thing rarely a female colead in sight unless its a reallife modelwife who hasnt worked since weird science and usually the worst possible titles you can imagine not to mention very straightforward plots generally allround bad dialogue and mr implacable leatherface himself in that same black outfit hes been in since nico doing his my hands are sharp nimble knives thing seagal the stoic sir petrified ponytail duke of dull in the glimmer man seagal breaks out of this formula he gets a sidekick attempts to banter and puts on a new vest hes also put on quite a lot of weight small potatoes you may say a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to but damnit if it aint broke why fix it more on this disappointed persons dashed expectations later as jack cole seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past while he and his partner played by keenen ivory wayans are investigating a series of ritual killings cole himself becomes a suspect especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin you just cant trust these homicide detectives someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them and hence well you know that glimmer man thing an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman bob gunton coles former cia boss brian cox and deals involving chemical weapons the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff drawing as with his other films elements from the hotter films of the year eg se7en its the other changes that disappoint for example although theres a fair amount of violence in this movie theres also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans probably the best known of the wayans tribe how many are there exactly from televisions in living colour wayans plays whiney straightman to seagals beadadorned and brocadedraped cole keeping up his are you crazy part of the dialogue with wasted zest as campbell wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partners eccentric habits but the chemistry between the two is minimal and seagals wooden comebacks make for painful watching a cook in under seige 2 seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble he chants refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies again a benign if trite plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual heck he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film is that a lot to ask of the seague too much seagals best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages and to do it silently and alone not for seagal the snappy oneliners of arnold and stallone nor the attempts to show that he can act much less think no kindergarten cop no oscar just simple unadulterated deathblows thats really how it must have started likeminded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else we trusted him we got to know him now betrayal i dont know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that hes going to try to be funny again ill try but it wont be easy if you havent watched the glimmer man yet you might want to wait for the video to come out its easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences after all if we cant depend on our fantasies what can we depend on the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan everybody makes mistakes once in awhile 
 the 13th warrior comes at the end of as summer where weve already experienced man eating sharks deep blue sea man eating crocodiles lake placid and even a man hunting witch the blair witch project now the 13th warrior presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears the story if thats what you want to call it follows ahmed ibn fahdlan antonio banderas an arabian poet who falls in love with his kings wife and is banished from his home land he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission and as you guessed it ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth hes not a warrior and at first not well accepted by the vikings but as the movie advances hell have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield thats basically the entire plot there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and one assumes drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didnt just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer the film is basically non stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock the battle scenes although well choreographed are not involving and not the least bit exciting we dont get to know any of the characters and so we dont care who lives and who dies the film which wants to be beowolf comes across more as a failed actionadventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels it was directed by john mctiernan whos the thomas crown affair is also playing in theaters currently and its not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that the 13th warrior was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences it belongs back on the shelf 
when i watch a movie like mike nichols what planet are you from i cant help but feel like everyone is looking at me its as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness eyes shooting daggers quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hardearned money to spend their time watching this this thing i shift uncomfortably in my seat im reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second or thirdrate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award its not my fault i know its not my fault but dammit someones gotta be embarrassed because it doesnt look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame im about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols do any of these names make you instantly shudder the answer i would have come up with before today is no this is quite a list of talented individuals weve got here granted john goodman was in the flintstones and greg kinnear has turned in some lessthanlackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours but even so theyve got proven power as excellent supporting players garry shandling has two television classics under his belt his ingenious little its garry shandlings show and the larry sanders show and for gods sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty so explain this this thing what planet are you from purports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole poppsychology marsvenus phenomenon but what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringeinducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringeinducing moments the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringeinducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males they reproduce through cloning of course his leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find a female of the species and impregnate her theyre taught how to pretend that theyre listening by nodding and saying uhhuh and how to compliment shoes imagine my delighted surprise when oh heavens all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably producing comedic results the lucky winner is fitted with a penis since theirs after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that theyre all just clones whoops too late the penis when aroused tends to make a humming noise the writers when frequently strapped for ideas tend to turn to this as a source of comedy it isnt funny the first time it isnt funny the eighth time it isnt funny the eighteenth time if anything it made me feel vaguely selfconscious garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear who turns out to be a generic unlikable scumbag hes meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandlings alien character but hes so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside kinnears scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks wow what a magnificent bastard nearly every man in the movie in fact is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball when kinnears wife walks into the office there isnt a single guy who doesnt trip bump into a wall or otherwise pratfall as if theyd never seen a woman before the few guys that arent particularly slimeballs such as john goodmans detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholics shandling meets up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnears aa meetings shandlings mission is to have a baby and when he reveals his desires to her bening instantly falls for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz ya see it turns out she wants a baby too benings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole then woe i say to the species shes unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic theres a point where after thinking she may not be able to bear children she learns that she is indeed pregnant when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her she strolls into the kitchen and sings high hopes you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then says to him now you cant leave me were supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing and eventually shandling falls in love with her for real i suppose though im not sure exactly what prompted it whats the message i derive from all this men are liars inherently empty creatures but if you hang around long enough well maybe something will click ha ha ha im thankful such broad cynicism isnt frequently allowed to run so rampant lets all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one theres also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity goodman through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic vibrating penis it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead it just dangles limply on the branch for a while withers and falls away further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies but lets not dwell on this any longer ive already wasted plenty of your time and my own lets move on forget about what weve seen here and get on with our lives and to help us out lets end things on a happy note congratuations go out to annette bening winner of this weeks title award for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movies name 
it seems like im reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now scream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground againthe serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the relentless department i still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend its citizen hook jennifer lovehewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie jameswho apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by waking up she lives in fear of ben willis the vengeful fishermanvictim of a hit and run by julie and her pals paranoid and beat she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla norwood winner of the local radio stations 4th of july getaway giveaway bikiniready julie invites boyfriend ray prinze jr whoand heres the movies biggest mysteryturns her down but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before takeoff until he gets a roadside visit from captain hellliner himself that is unaware of this and feeling shunned julie goes on vacation anyway with karla karlas boyfriend pfeiffer and will matthew settle a real boynextdoor type whos sweet on julie to make a long story shorti cant believe it took a paragraph to describe the setup for this gratuitous sequelthe trip is a disaster not only is it storm season not only is the desk clerk the frighteners jeffrey combs a jerk not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis onebyone but the karaoke machine isnt working properly you think killing is hard try reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynors i will survive now contains the lyric i still know what you did last summer all is not lostray is on his way to save the day and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co this picture is really about breasts two of them julie like a good horror heroine never does up her shirt to the collar always wears white in the rain and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie i cant imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to mehe gets jennifer lovehewitt and my generation got heather langenkamp lucky bastard i didnt like i know what you did last summer and i cant say i liked this continuation any more or less the pacing in both films is languidhow is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development i still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one though and at least it explains away williss random selection of victims i dont think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer director cannon judge dredd is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative oneif there is a part three what on earth would they call it and the fun denouement suggests there will be heres my suggestion hire a filmmaker with flair someone who can really energize this stillborn seriessomeone who wont rely on so many shock notes and let that person run wild with the camera aside if blandy sic must appear in the next one try to keep the number of times she says baby to a minimum thanks in advance 
were back in blade runner territory with this one conceptual artist robert longos vision of a william gibsoninspired future where information is the commodity to kill for front and center is johnny keanu reeves a cybercourier who smuggles data via a wetwired implant hes ready to quit the biz and get a portion of his longterm memory restored but first he has to finish one last dangerous job the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how to play an action hero since his stint on speed hes walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins icet and dina meyer dolph lundgrens street preacher is in an acting category all its own without a believable performance between them all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere which is pretty good in places the vr sequences are way cool but the physical fxsuch as miniatures and mattesleave a lot to be desired watch out for those bad bluescreens we wouldnt mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better too bad the debut director isnt very strong in this de partment his big finale is a sloppy silly mess that runs twenty minutes too long which is way past the time that most of our wet wired processors have already shut down bottom line yatf yet another tortured future skip it 
ok i admit iti find camp amusement with the spice girls yes the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual identities they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of girl power but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isnt enough to carry their big screen debut a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world the film begins amusingly enough with a cheeky 007esque title sequence in which the british quintet scary melanie brown baby emma bunton sporty melanie chisolm ginger geri halliwell and posh victoria adams are introduced one by one to much to my surprise excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience as they croon the silky ballad too much a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film a few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film 1 the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at londons royal albert hall 2 a film producer george wendt and a screenwriter mark mckinney pitch various film ideas to the girls manager clifford richard e grant 3 a documentary film crew follows the girls 4 a pregnant mate naoki mori of the group rapidly approaches her due date and 5 a tabloid publisher barry humphries attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug richard obrien capped off by a live rendition of the girls bouncy hit say youll be there a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow right wrong its all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches i must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them much less a organized framework for all the wacky goingson spice world jumps from vignette to vignette subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense at one minute having the girls meet with aliens no joke and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and thereduring a dance bootcamp scene the girls sing the lyric we know how we got this farstrength and courage and a wonderbra much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level some gags are just plain pointless such as roger moores recurring role as the mysterious chief who dispenses cryptic metaphorheavy advice to clifford the only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond ha ha as weak as the script is i think theres one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie and that is the girls themselves the point is not that they cant act and for the record they really cant but that their individual personas which works as a gimmick over the span of a fourminute music video are too thin to survive outside of the truncated video bite mtv world posh who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions comes off best by default because her persona rich bitch most easily translates into character in a film babys persona young innocent to a lesser extent also works but the remaining girls identities are a little harder to flesh out there really isnt much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often which is exactly what fuller and spiers do and after all what exactly entails being ginger or scary apparently just their wardrobes spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices signature hit wannabe the song is as grating as ever but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a muchneeded shot in the arm setting the stage for a wave of selfreferential humor stemmed from the screenwriters film ideas the film almost mirrors robert altmans the player in the way the film snails into itself this section of the film involving all manner of derringdo involving a speeding bus is perhaps its most effective but it also points up how all the other storylines the publisher the documentary crew lack a satisfactory payoff spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family and it will please the spice faithful but this sloppy enterprise surely wont win them any new fans which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states once the hype disappears spice world will likely serve as the the spices final hurrah in america 
sylvester stallone has made some crap films in his lifetime but this has got to be one of the worst a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting the specialist is about as exciting as an episode of dragnet and about as well acted even some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script stupid and unlikable characters and just plain nothingness who knew a big explosion could be so boring and anticlimactic unless you saw blown away the specliast of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone in comeback 19 i think who plays a quiet hermitlike bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant james woods who shows us exactly what overthetop is other than another bad sly film accidentally killed some innocent people during a job his credo is killing bad people not innocents and thats why he makes big bombs so anyway into his life steps the seductive sharon stone who is basically the girlfriendmoll of the stupid son eric roberts of a cubanmiami kingpin rod steiger in an indecipherable accent which is sometimes cuban sometimes brando sometimes scottish etc turns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him since he killed her parents when she was young so she calls sly leaves messages with him sends him email etc about planting a bomb to kill roberts which sly listens to obsessively and while he works out naked yea also into his life though again comes woods who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly using the cops he tries to set up traps none which really work so when sly calls him he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone getting so worked up by saying his mustbeimprovised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open these are the most exciting scenes in the film and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film the film tries to offer us a moody film noir except with explosions but comes up completely snakeeyes its just a pretend film noir making it a big waste of time and for action buffs the action scenes are pretty lame with some really unrealisticlooking special effects a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub then theres the muchdiscussed sex scene between sly and stone which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on friends their sex scene is more nauseating then sexy because it shows us more of sly than stone now lets guess who wed rather see naked okay stones small but perky breasts which weve seen more times than harvey keitels dick or stallones veiny ass which isnt usually shown for a very good reason i know i cant really judge it as a flaw of the film but come on the worst flaw of the film is this its boring i mean i was on caffeine when watching it but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting but a good movie does not james woods going nuts make if youre in for some fun action rent slys earlier demolition man which sucks too but in a much more entertaining fashion skip this dull film unless you want to see woods or make fun of steigers accent or see stones breasts again 
the skulls is a laughably bad thriller a teenorientated doppelganger of the firm so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter i chuckled incessantly all the way home let me share the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale designed im sure to mirror the actual skull bones from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlights the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women driving a new car and marveling at the 20 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstances become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe as a drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately the skulls is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting its just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack the stars but not the script the skulls is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers first off upon their initiation into the skulls each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters gee why not member tshirts but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions they are given official skull paddles when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way means a disagreement wouldnt they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play pingpong im still chuckling about these ludicrous details but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawsons creek crowd and fuses the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actors like craig t nelson as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson as fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricatures and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then theres christopher mcdonald who has the capacity to be a fun exciting actor mcdonalds charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue makes it a hattrick i pray it was a snatchthepaycheckandrun exercise for all these actors the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better lets cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blues is bland but passable as caleb mandrake the judges son walker preserves a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who plays lukes longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one or maybe not minute one thanks to a decent setup from director rob cohen who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style it makes you wonder why he didnt flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight arent superior cinema they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash aside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skulls gets little accomplished the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage weve seen it all before and better the skulls is a feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve as a clever pun a term like boneheaded seems just too generous 
its difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of awardwinning tv commercials as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes that said hayess feature film debut lives up to expectations coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic but occasionally bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective hyper religious reaganloving mother gyllenhalls sweetnatured delivery of jimmys hilariously na ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy comingofage story jimmy is a bubble boy a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld his mom homeschools jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and antisexual messages until hes befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door jimmy falls in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love the offensive bits have little to do with jimmys rare handicap regardless of what the films protesters would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi but even if you find stereotype humor funny its hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly shows the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and a wacky sendup of a cult called bright n shiny led by the inimitable fabio unfortunately a few giggles cant make bubble boy the riotous offthewall comedy it so desperately wants to be honestly its a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made and im not just saying that because its so mediocre how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesnt seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of reallife bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disneys wondering the same thing hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile 
bats is this years camp flick with the worlds worst dialogue cheesiest premise and stupidest editor this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity as for the rest of us well id say skip it but looking at the box office figures for this one it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway follow their lead and youll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot i love alfred hitchcocks the birds almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based it saddens me even more then to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horrorschlock such as bats when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town the authorities call in a batologist dina meyer to investigate it turns out that a creepy scientist bob gunton has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab making them smarter and more vicious why has he done this you ask because you see it is apparently a scientists job to make things a little better even if that means the death of all mankind so the batologist her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff lou diamond phillips have to kill all the bats and save the world of course that cant happen before they wallow in some guamo bat shit for the uninitiated get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture consider for example a scene where two people are in a bat cave the bats are all sleeping but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out what do they do do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can nope they stand there for a while transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes we dont even get to see whats going on the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick all we know is that bats are attacking how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies and bats sure could use some of course director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor but it is so conventional it doesnt really go anywhere most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologists wisecracking sidekick leon who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like i hate bats some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame oneliners playing such characters does not help actors careers still i suppose that if youre looking for a movie that is so bad its good you could do worse than bats it does have a tremendous amount of camp value im not recommending the movie because quite frankly it sucks and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it more power to them 
starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960s classic a term that i use very loosely to define the original about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesnt exactly hurt it either fast forward to the late 80s steve mcqueen isnt in the remake this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role that is unless you count matt dillons brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets the special effects in this movie are cheesy like the originals unlike the original they dont look campy they just look cheap one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith she is very attractive and can actually act which is more than i can say about some of her costars in terms of plot a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite anyway the pink stuff has a taste for humans the more people it absorbs the bigger it gets and it isnt the friendliest goop on the block either anyway it attacks this little town and its up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it not really but that is how it seems this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original as ive already said this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap badly acted and badly written than campy in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness although star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud although some of the films smaller roles are filled with some actors that while not big stars are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible sadly it doesnt work very well if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original although that isnt so hot either this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities

if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a latenight cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80s theyd agree d c cab is the quintessential usa up all nite movie its one of those childish rrated movies that kids would love but cant see until its edited for tv its also one of those pointless almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs and strike three it pairs mr t with gary busey i heard gilbert say d c cab had an allstar cast but im still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement when thirdbilling goes to a twominute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara as herself you cant say a damn thing about allstar casts likewise for token appearances by marsha roz warfield paul rodriguez and politically incorrect host bill maher before he was somebody appearing in d c cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else especially irene im gonna live forever cara d c cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher who would go on to direct batman forever about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice this would be the result except here you have such interesting characters as the token white guy busey who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world the token jive talker named tyrone charlie barnett who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word honkey as much as possible the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains mr t a real stretch for him the aspiring musician waiting for his big break maher the mexican gigolo rodriguez the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living warfield and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living adam baldwin weve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80s some are fun to watch and some are actually funny this one is more or less neither youd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent whatever but d c cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him its a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality d c cab has rightly earned its position on usa up all nite 
written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam ive always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last then theres the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychninelaced dose mushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel a steady reassuring assent a short period of thrilling motion and color and then a smooth landing acid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie full of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s thompsons book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological worldview from the inside out but for those of us who just want to enjoy a wellmade film gilliam has produced a mixed bag fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 operating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr gonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and a rainbow of multicolored uppers and downers they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge dr gonzo becomes enamored of a thickbladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplanes white rabbit reaches its climax and these guys dont just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view thompsons book besides being a hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document it simultaneously exposed the 60s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompsons message but the truth is that stripped to its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy its a cheech and chong movie youre there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down theres nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam tries too hard this is a frantic movie all sweaty closeups wideangle lenses dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen but to what end much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book and there are some priceless comic observations but youre hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work this brings us to the performances which strike me as all wrong depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c scott in patton a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompsons dialogue in between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something to see its interesting to note that alex cox credited as a cowriter on the screenplay was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over as much of a fan as i am of gilliams work cox would have been the better choice sid and nancy coxs best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film gilliam commits the compound sin of overdirecting his film while being uncertain of his purpose what kind of movie was he trying to make anyway it doesnt try to be a cautionary tale and it doesnt work as broad comedy if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been a much more interesting film but i dont want to be too hard on it there are some truly funny moments and if youre in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it i do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance i guarantee it will enhance the effect 
the best thing about lake placid is that its only 80 minutes long and when its over youre glad that you didnt waste more than an hour and a half of your time its nothing more than a bad ripoff of jaws and i think thats being kind it was written by david e kelly ally mcbeal as a horrorcomedy but fails at both miserably i was never scared and i think that i only laughed once the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in anaconda the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine that brings the local sheriff brendan gleeson and a fishandgame warden bill pulman to investigate also a paleontologist bridget fonda from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionairecrocodile lover oliver platt flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it theres also an eccentric old lady betty white who lives by the lake and has a few secrets as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor h20 dont go for a serious approach towards the material but they also dont have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting theyre all basically idiots if they had any brains the croc wouldnt have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldnt have put themselves in half of the situations that they did but then again if they were smart there wouldnt be a movie basically lake placid is best undiscovered 
that is unless youre one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters i can tell you one thing now they gave the entire movie away why someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me however if they hadnt given it away the film wouldve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter obviously the producers thought they could remake the deep end of the ocean throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama double jeopardy offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones who got first billing even though he didnt see to be on screen half as much as judd did it also offers some genuinely funny clever or fulloftension moments my favorite judd waking up in the coffin but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot half the time im wondering whether im watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised judging by the beginning end and a huge chunk of the middle i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too the movies stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material implausible material no less loose interpretation of one of the amendments aside too many times in the movie i thought that is not possible that kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies but not one like double jeopardy that tries to pass itself off as serious drama everything seems dragged out overplayed when they shouldve kept us in the dark they let the cat out of the bag too early 
i had an epiphany today it occurred to me while i was watching house on haunted hill it is as follows if a trailer makes the film its advertising look like a trashy stupid movie well guess what chances are there is truth in advertising too bad i didnt trust my own instincts when somethingortheother possessed me to see this movie i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of sleepy hollow that and dogma started too late in the afternoon for my schedule an hour of angel or buffy is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face i wish id seen it when it was halloween at least i would have been forgiving hey tis the season the movie was scary albeit very confusing dizzying and nauseating at first but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasnt going anywhere now i truly appreciate films like scream halloween or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic thats what spooks people out the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with sure utterly unpredictable is good too but thats different from utterly nonsensical hohh house on haunted hill on the other hand well lets just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they ohsocleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago riiiiight yknow that just sends chills down my spine yeah just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil ooooooo hint blood and guts only work a few times sooner or later people start to tell themselves that its just ketchup and props and youve got to come up with something better than that there were just too many things in this movie that weve all seen before from the inevitable plot developments of strangers unwittingly trapped together strangers turning against each other the evil manifesting itself the dead coming back for a last scare each was more predictable than the last why didnt these fools just stay together in one place anyways sheesh was i grossed out yes did i get spooked a few times yes but why i get really disturbed when there is no why when there werent random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect which wasnt that good either trust me and the scare the film was filled with drab laughable dialogue the characters were incredibly flat and cliched not to mention downright annoying youve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives of course theyre dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night jeez i thought no one fell for those you may already be a winner things anymore and of course all three gals are babes i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of shine ended up in this movie keep that up geoff and youll qualify for the next batman venture the only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because well he just cracks me up and famke jansen sp because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan pierce brosnan hey i willingly endured dantes peak three times for him all right i concede there were a couple of things i enjoyed that perverted little amusement park at the beginning i probably wont ride a rollercoaster for a while and the machine they used to drive geoffreys character mad see i dont even remember their names the machine not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it i kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie it wouldnt have redeemed the film but at least it would have made me feel better but no they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending thank god they didnt add a kiss at the end or i would have puked god there is no hope 
director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film the dreadful comedy steal big steal little was funny keanu id rather play music than play another action hero reeves is the grad student on the run who along with his superfluous sidekick rachel weisz has been framed for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks the mushroomcloud explosion is a knockout and easily the best part of the movie or as one audience member succinctly summed it up whoa false information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run fleeing over open drawbridges across icy lakes and through the corridors of power at a topsecret underground energy facility aiding and abetting is the teams shady mentor played in an excellentbutso what performance by morgan freeman brit brian cox is also about as the behindthescenes bad guy he has some fun fiddling with a southern accent unfunny overscored and without a single shred of suspense chain reaction is the summer movie to walk out on if you make it to the end a mess of crosscutting involving another imminent explosion youll hear somebody say i guess its time to go heed that warning 
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets gloria a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre suddenly i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in when a movie is over arent we supposed to think about it for a while and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with i thought so but for one i saw this particular picture by myself and 2 even if i had been with someone there wouldnt have been anything to talk about in the first place to be sure gloria begins with a stirring rather poignant prologue in which a sevenyearold boys family is brutally gunned down by mobsters in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it right before the men broke in of course his father gave him the disc to escape with eventually the boy named nicky nunez jeanluke figueroa is caught by the mobsters and taken back to their apartment meanwhile gloria sharon stone has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didnt commit and returns to her exboyfriend jeremy northam to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime when he refuses to give it to her and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky she leaves with him in order to save his life but not before holding the men at gunpoint stealing all of their money and forcing them to strip nude gloria is the type of fasttalking smartmouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people and she never expected to be stuck with a kid but she has a heart of gold dont they always in this type of movie and is only trying to protect the boy whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with the previous incarnation of gloria by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands remains unseen by me but was no doubt superior even though i cant really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one regardless of the director or stars there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original but the film itself is simply lifeless with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isnt completely unbearable to watch i liked for example a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at and keeps turning the car around then driving a little ways then slamming on the brakes and turning around again these bright moments however appear long and far between and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria which is both painfully predictable and bythenumbers throughout my mind was repeatedly asking the question who really cares as gloria sharon stone has adopted an overthetop brooklyn accent that honestly doesnt sound realistic at all in the beginning in fact i was amazed at how amateurish stones performance was but as the film progressed she got better although not one of her better turns stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored jeanluke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted none more than cathy moriarty an entertaining actress in her own right who is billed fourth and has all of one scene as glorias friend whom she turns to for help sony the studio that released gloria obviously does not have any faith in the film and i dont blame them they declined to screen the picture for critics which is never a good sign particularly with the highprofile people involved although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is just look at the spectacular in dreams which failed to even make the top 10 last week i have a suspicion gloria is going to vanish from theaters faster than ishtar judging from the opening night 7 00 p m showing i saw it at where there were about ten to fifteen people present counting myself although stone can be an impressive actress just watch her in 1995s casino or 1996s last dance if you dont believe me and sidney lumet can be a respectable director there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of gloria was worth remaking or for that matter why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful 
prereview note seeing as the only concern of body shots is sex i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review because of this i will try to vary word descriptions of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend fret not its most likely just another way of referring to sex i think wed all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously in the way youd normally expect to see a violent attack its about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are things we all do sometimes the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts their lives center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed its as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek at its core body shots is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say his characters dont communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitudes like i like to come or sex without love equals violence huh and yes that is as complex as this movies observations get the characters are stupid and shallow with not one registering as anything more the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such events we meet the characters as they speak directly to us confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them giving you the pros and cons but for this film i cannot im not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breasts defined abs pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one only because his character gets the worst lines sex without love equals violence in between all the confessionals cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f kobsessed fine i dont have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only gives us one side additionally that one side isnt even entertaining the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other alas if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isnt it erotic it isnt real it doesnt feel like an authentic sexual encounter every f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serves me i cant think of one film that has done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80s next to wall street unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care not the writer the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here though boogie nights succeeded it was similarly moralistic but it gave us two different viewpoints it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters and it showed us the possible fallout of such a decision the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones he preaches to us by using his characters to preach to us this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin skins cristofer kind of does that though without an ounce of insight and with a helping of leering exploitation 
im guessing and from the available evidence its not a great guess that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess stupidity ego and powermongering if so the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history it has already been welldocumented that the original title an alan smithee film became a problem when miserable test screenings forced recuts against the will of director arthur hiller prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors guildmandated pseudonym of alan smithee that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor and you could just smell the disaster brewing if youre unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn youll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up ostensibly its a pseudodocumentary account of a director named alan smithee eric idle who loses control of a bigbudget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone whoopi goldberg and jackie chan all of whom appear as themselves when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called an alan smithee film which of course it already is smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it among the parties interviewed are the films producer james edmunds ryan oneal and studio boss jerry glover richard jeni who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them its bad enough that burn hollywood burn has literally not a single laugh for its entire blissfully brief 84 minutes what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once but twice or even three times michael ovitz references showgirls references oral sex references whoopi goldbergted danson references all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas stockintrade the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency notably with the hilarious use of the word feminist as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent filmmakers the brothers brothers cleverly identified as bad a and badder a among other unprintable things you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified those documentary captions for all their leaden obviousness allow the best insight into whats so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears the producer is a liar who slept in the white house the media are maggots and leeches working for publications like the new york slimes and newsleak with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you dont miss the joke it doesnt even matter that eszterhas tags penile implant after his own name when he makes a cameo because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign selfdeprecation this is a petulant schoolboys idea of satire pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth the last stomachchurning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with outtakes over the closing credits the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away perhaps it was just a final desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career pity everyone involved with this excessive egodriven satire of excess and ego its too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this otherwise you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees 
 meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood screams the television ads for hanging up disastrously written by reallife sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two costars lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameos but they dont actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion eve marks meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with a husband adam arkin and preteen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in years has just recently been put into the hospital in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimers even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him while eves relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her children years ago she has had her fair share of ups and downs with lou who used to be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the selftitled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest a soap opera actress interestingly their professions are given but we not once ever see them working at their jobs or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long if you are able to get through the opening halfhour in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating selfinvolved patontheback how could a comedydrama that has the starpower of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isnt mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying threeminute scene in which they argue like little children you can see the impending death coming a mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves and with each other you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have a playful foodfight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credits meg ryan is a versatile actress look no further than 1998s hurlyburly or 1994s when a man loves a woman despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies with hanging up the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron a writerdirectorhack who shouldnt be allowed to work in hollywood again after this bigbudget highprofile debacle even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scenes that work flashbacks to christmas 1988 when she had a heartbreaking runin with her mother and to halloween 1993 when lou crashed her sons birthday party in a drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations diane keaton as georgia is better as an actress than a director here but that is a wildly feeble compliment what is more than a little farfetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children she is no more than five years ryans senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a bigscreen venture after her even more thin role in 1999s analyze this kudrow isnt given enough time to create a full personality with maddy so it isnt her fault she doesnt register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is a real talent and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time as in her brilliantly nuanced oscarcaliber work in 1998s the opposite of sex if you are a fan of kudrows and who isnt do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than hanging up does in its entirety as eves hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do until a subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again cloris leachman as with ryan and matthau makes a small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg as a rosycheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotions displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions 
under any other circumstances i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review however in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful a minute dissection of the ending is necessary even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes do proceed at your own risk the movie opens quite poorly i might add as child psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolms past patients distraught the suicidal man a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself cut to the next fall as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case a trouble young man named cole haley joel osment one of the only child actors in a while i didnt want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences we learn that cole has the sixth sense the gift of being able to communicate with the dead and this as they say is where the healing begins the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film one of roger eberts colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of siskel and ebert although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ive always been a sucker for surprise endings my favorite movie is the usual suspects and rarely dislike a film that sports one here since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the films conclusion the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending something ive fallen victim to in the past was eliminated and indeed my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment stripped of the element of surprise the film was put to the task of showing what it really had instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion after seeing its true colors i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is despite what the many champions of the movie may say void of any real power its a neat concept but not one that justifies being made into a featurelength movie in fact the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earthshattering revelation that is yet to come and when the final moments do come its a huge letdown the end makes no sense at all it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level i wont go into any details but suffice to say that as far as i can tell it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder now in all fairness i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending however stupid it may be had it not been revealed to me before hand however i feel very confident that i as well as anyone who had seen a few twilight zone episodes would have seen it coming a mile away the fact that moviegoers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped ironically to fully appreciate the best scene that of cole and malcolm attending a little girls funeral the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy i wouldnt have even known about this mental disease if i hadnt by pure dumb luck caught dateline nbc the other week when they did a feature story on it despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace in the end the sixth sense is too chalkfull of contradictions and just isnt plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation 
brian de palmas snake eyes stars nicolas cages evil twin who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood cage yells with the ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload de palma whose last great film the untouchables was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic in snake eyes he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material the rest of the actors become caricatures in this bythenumbers thriller ryuichi sakamotos atmospheric and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene heavy on the long violin notes its rhythm is punctuated by thunder the script by de palma and lost worlds david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise only the latter is achieved cage plays rick santoro a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held with a flashy bad wardrobe and a gold cell phone rick is an obnoxious cop who doesnt know when to shut up spouting cliched and ridiculous dialog he screams such lines as i was made for the sewer baby actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole sinise plays kevin dunne a naval officer who is in charge of the security for the secretary of the navy who has come to watch the fight but most people in the film are not who they seem to be and the thin script makes all of them easy to guess the plot which is told in endless flashbacks concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen that adjective is of course redundant in hollywood thrillers the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie the movies outline has some promise but the movie itself is leaden the film takes itself all too seriously at best it is a 1940sstyle b movie a little humor would have helped the script some but a complete rewrite would have been better and although i hate to say it a different director would have been the biggest improvement snake eyes runs 1 39 it is rated r for violence and would be acceptable for teenagers 
a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities the result is merely an academic exercise leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldnt build on to show them as the poets they were on paper this shouldnt have been so terrible it had a talented director in agnieszka holland the secret garden a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton dangerous liaisons and a capable cast but the film was done in by its inept script the unappealing way the film was directed and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade he especially looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be but when the two of them were together it looked like a mismatch leonardos rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude yet we know from rimbauds poetry that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring the film opens in postrevolutionary france in 1871 the 16yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems he accepts verlaines praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville once there rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household has an immediate conflict with verlaines busty 18yearold wife mathilde romane and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her familys money even though he has nothing else in common with her when verlaine states poets can learn from one another rimbaud replies in a haughty tone only if theyre bad poets he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship verlaine proves to be weakwilled beating his wife regularly and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud when mathildes father kicks rimbaud out of the house verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers its a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce in brussels verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gunrunner and after ten years there comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying the film ends on a whimper with verlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published this film was especially annoying because rimbauds poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film but whatever it was it just didnt work it certainly didnt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry 
in our time in our modern world where the cool rule its hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man and yet film after film after film is based on his everlasting magic in warner brothers latest production shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeares romeo and juliet its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york is very hard to associate with shakespeares poetry the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city the afro americans against the chinese the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered the afroamericans are immediately suspected but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers it is at this point that han the romeo of the story finds out about his brothers death escaping from a prison in china he returns to united states to avenge his brothers fate but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks he falls in love with a mysterious beauty the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy theres only a weak echo of shakespeares talent in this disappointing production and there are more problems besides its title of course we dont call it a deformation of a great masterpiece we call it modernization it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics without any car chases and gun fights this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesnt need to be updated because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature and as long as love hate honesty and corruption do exist everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare i must admit that i found rome must die very confusing i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak since it is his first attempt at directing he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision unfortunately he completely forgot about character and story developments his latest picture is therefore visually impressive but intellectually hollow the love story between han jet li and trish aalyah and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice their achievement save this film from being completely braindead but they are not actors and therefore can not act they are nothing more than two celebrities put together the other actors including isaiah washington russell wong henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality but theres more than acting to worry about even with lis incredible skills in martial arts the action scenes though technically excellent are too long and story updates simply embarrassing to make a long story short romeo must die is not intelligent enough to be a thriller not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to romeo and juliet so the film is completely stuck not sure of what to be and in the end its nothing there are no performances worthy of notice no interesting character or story surprises so again the only good thing about it is its technical achievement this film can boast of great sound fast paced editing solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre it is mostly provided by aalyahs enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists that create a kind of ghetto feel to it but when i think back its not much i remember from this production as in almost every summer movie there are some interesting scenes but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities simply because it doesnt have any for someone who has never read shakespeare its another popcorn film for those of us who has its a waste of money time and brain cells 
isnt it the ultimate sign of a movies cinematic ineptitude when you cant think of much to say about it other than it sucks one of the first official year 2000 releases supernova is such a movie i cant seem to get past oneword adjectives with this one although boring stupid and absurd doesnt amount to much of a review a shame i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate but cest la vie here goes nothing ill keep it short i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill 48 hours removed his name from the movie requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee the films fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press an event usually signifying a studios lack of confidence in a particular movie hills and mgms actions were prudent when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer for some reason james spader is forced to take command the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and on arrival picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony one of the crew members angela bassett knows this passenger who is played by peter facinelli and has some bad feelings about it and we all know what that means this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it another one of the crew members experiences this first hand after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo he does some impressive handstand pushups evidently touching this enigmatic eggshaped thingie makes you younger and stronger how why the movie never bothers to explain soon enough though spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad being chased by the allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli to be honest i dont even remember exactly why i just remember that i didnt care supernovas plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing in fact everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set well the effects are good though theres hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so im not sure whether thats so remarkable an accomplishment the performances are hardly worth talking about im not even sure i can call whats here performances though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger james spader is not a bad actor but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars ive seen in a while mostly because he isnt given a character with a personality the action scenes are just as bland since theyre pretty much just rehashes of action elements that werent particularly entertaining the first time around and since the action scenes are everything to this movie its pretty much dead in the water and for the life of me i cant figure out why its called supernova 
 idle hands is distasteful crass and derivative if an original thought found its way into this horrorcomedy it would die of loneliness plus you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teenagers the week after the tragedy in littleton colo the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teenagers the plot what little there is deals with anton devon sawa a highschool slacker whos hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed along the way the hand kills antons parents and his two best friends the friends also slackers are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them that is the level of thiss atrocitys humor the movie treats death as a joke idle hands is gruesome and morbid the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish i realize this is supposed to pass for comedy but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen it is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life and i can only presume that the writers of idle hands terri hughes and ron milbauer were trying to make some statement about todays young people and their values in a satiric vein however its hard to laugh at death these days especially ones involving young people with the real horrors of the world put before us on television a stale pastry such as idle hands should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths idle hands is bad no matter the circumstances in the world outside but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings the time is not right for this type of movie and as far as idle hands goes the time may never be right this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema 
a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in handwringing detail still i cant recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love and after it i still cant bye bye love is rarely funny more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tvmovie fare only a few moments which have nothing to do with the films main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children dave matthew modine a father of two is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend vic randy quaid is a foulhumored father of three about to go on a rare date donny paul reiser pines for his exwife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma eliza dushku over the course of the weekend the three men face various crises including vics blind date from hell janeane garofolo and donnys growing estrangement from emma the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality randy quaid is the best of the three bitter without being irritating gleefully spiteful without being frightening his runins with is exwife lindsey crouse are a bit overplayed though and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist rob reiner is gimmicky and implausible he does get bye bye loves best subplot a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo and he does a great slow burn paul reiser really has only one character his slightly befuddled uptight nice guy mad about you persona but he does it well as a personality he is appealing but as a character he becomes pretty boring here matthew modine is quite simply terrible this isnt a performance good enough to be called mailedin he even forgot to put a stamp on it modine lacks any charm in an appallingly underwritten role looks bored most of the time and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how its all his fathers fault hes such a cad carolcos executives whose entire future is resting on modines bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island must be sweating buckets right now bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids making it just another dating in the 90s movie when the movie does deal with the children at all it is to have one of them scream out an accusation andor cry perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug perhaps not even more confusing is a subplot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonalds and befriends a troubled youth it is a sad end to flanders career getting caught up in a truly annoying overuse of mcdonalds as a location a plot device and apparently a major advertiser even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parentchild relationships it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family breakups and their effects on children any way you slice it it is a bad situation for kids and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue it is left to the dads romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is and it isnt enough there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching bye bye love is a genuine shame 
according to the publicity material with this movie the directors hope to restore good oldfashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness hmm you never know they just might be on to something what with the rise of geek chic lounge music and seventies fashion the evercontrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own but then i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it its cheesy all right but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch thats a shame because in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise roy munson the movie opens in the fifties with roys dad dishing out the readers digestgumpian wisdom in scoopfuls shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken its thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good he gives the wry derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roys hand then its fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand hes hopeless until he meets ishmael randy quaid an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno picking up pretty hustler claudia vanessa angel on the way with the exit of bill murray the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go and thats dumb and dumber yes indeed kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour peter and bobby farrelly the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle so prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands distended nipples ridiculous hair and bull semen get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking striptease and unchristian neighboursocking now dont get me wrong theres nothing wrong with cheap humour and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy the trouble is that these jokes arent bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack never quite getting it all together some gags fall flat from a lack of buildup while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply dont do anything why the long unfunny fight in the car park why two of these why does that guy wear mascara or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it the film is full of these halfthoughtthrough ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying wouldnt that be funny well no actually the actors dont do the movie much favours either woody harrelson comes off okay plausibly acting dumb smart cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham and vanessa angel has no talent like schwarzenegger she seems more convincing playing a computercreation than a human take the tv series weird science please even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movies climax all in all a fairly useless attempt at comedy and a certified nohoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance well have to look to a reinspired john waters or perhaps somebody from down under strictly bowling anyone for the definitive bowling comedy the flying inkpots rating system wait for the video a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
starring kiefer sutherland reese witherspoon bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen freeway is giving me second thoughts freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood only in the nineties little red riding hood is a foulmouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon and the big bad wolf is a serial killer keifer sutherland to top that pathetic premise off reese goes to visit granny and youll never guess whos waiting under the covers in grannys bed keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented yet underrated actors and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star so what are they doing in this movie after seeing the end result undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review the answer is quite simple i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it note to keifer you wonder why you arent a bigger star in hollywood because you keep making movies like this note to reese you were great in fear what happened this time note to both dont worry about it too much no one saw this movie anyway bottom line im still shaking my head dont waste your time on this turkey if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie go rent flatliners or young guns reese witherspoons abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear a great thriller do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can 
synopsis in sooner than you think america the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs a dangerous criminal however attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them comments so what do an exgangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common why theyre all members of blade squad an elite new crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms rollerblades and jetpacks they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james camerons aliens yes its blade squad the fox networks wednesday night movie of the week this movie marking its dubious world premiere today curiously has a number of guest stars how can a movie have guest stars you may ask well blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie blade squad is dumb blade squad is loud blade squad is obnoxious blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a longlived tv series why not after all television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars knight rider fast helicopters airwolf and super fast motorcycles street hawk and viewers have eaten it up in the past so why not crimefighters with jetpowered roller blades to be honest as a madefortv presentation blade squad is at least watchable the film has a relatively large cast of characters a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script and enough action sequences to keep one halfinterested id imagine adolescent males probably the target audience of this turkey would get a kick out of it i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad i can remember liking airwolf and street hawk when i was 10 or 11 and although this isnt saying much blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on the insipidly awful generation x a huge disappointment considering the comic books terrific twoyear beginning but i digress despite its limited appeal blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series one it suffers from mtv syndrome a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewers senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background oh yeah dylans knockin on heavens door and bowies im afraid of americans are used here in rather poor taste two blade squad needs a new crew for the sound the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end characters dialogue at times sounded choppy and unintelligible during one important scene a song played loudly in the background when a character spoke the songs volume dropped but did not disappear as soon as that character finished speaking the songs volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke this sounds trivial im sure but it distracted me immensely finally this is commercial television foul language is not allowed typically on commercial television thus dont use foul language in a madefortv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner in an early scene of the film for example the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets when the good guy spouts out a bad word a driver conveniently honks his cars horn offscreen to muffle the word out in a seinfeld episode this technique proved funny here it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably perhaps future writers if a show is spun out of the movie could take a cue from marvel comics 2099 series of comics make up a bunch of new bad words for the future this way you dont need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp when compared to say a movie studio film blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials bs review written august 12 1998 
what a contrast in the space of two days i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly im not sure you could get two more different movies while the former was all over the top telegraphing everything shoving its philosophy of life down our throats hurlyburly was the complete opposite wound so tight and with so much buried in its script one could spend weeks thinking about it this is one interesting movie its very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of 98 in the company of men although not quite so nasty theres lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men hurlyburly doenst contain much plot we just follow eddie sean penn around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him his big question is does it all pertain to him and if it does how is he supposed to feel about it all it means everything television friends events that happen i guess it could be summed up more crudely as whats it all about this is not a movie for answers donna anna paquin gives some but theyre not really satisfying they just lead to more questions thats what makes this movie stay on your mind these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time even when we push them to the background however we resolve these questions influences everything we do the performances are all superb in hurlyburly i havent seen sean penn in much before in fact i cant remember seeing him in anything but he is brilliant in this eddie isnt a likeable character but sean penn makes him understandable i dont want to be his friend but id like to help him chazz palminteri is also great as phil making him an awful person id never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend everyone in this film nails their performances making this world real its a nasty world its a sexist world unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct hurlyburly is a mans world seen unapologetically through the eyes of men i find this fascinating and on two counts depressing first its depressing that such a world exists a large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world toys playthings sure everyone is background to everyone else but in this world women are a long way in the background second these are the movies that are being made stories about mens world where are the stories about womens world not the soap operas and the chick flicks that are meant to satisfy women but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts its very talkative intelligent and static while this can make the film drag a bit and people sometimes sound like theyre quoting textbooks mostly this is a good thing not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen it also means that you have to pay attention 
capsule the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smiths films gets their own movie the gags are sporadically funny it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and antigay jokes the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night and it turns out he had very good reasons low 0 4 to 4 a film needs a plot it needs characters for empathy value it needs a story and an emotional center if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are kevin smith has now made two satisfying films clerks and chasing amy with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it his remaining two films mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes penis jokes flatulence jokes film pastiches and injokes how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call for me the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny there was not enough cleverness or variety it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay penis jokes work only so many times showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british postwar films including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks this leaves them at loose ends they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny silent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have jay has to be the comic he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen beforesometimes just minutes before like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving they are excuses for gags many of which still fall flat it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content the film does not offer much to an adult audience i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the 4 to 4 scale 
the previews for the movie are pretty good they show a little plot all the characters and the emotional highlights all spliced together to give a general impression of the script unfortunately the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes the residents of mystery love hockey mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player whos guilty of shooting another man yes thats one of the movies jokes every saturday the best players pair off for a game and the whole town comes to watch the towns prodigal son charlie hank azaria wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated mysterys national fame has the town abuzz a week later charlie actually shows up in person and he brings with him an offer from the nhl the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals the mysterians see this as both good and bad on the one hand theyd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition on the other hand they dont want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition biebe russell crowe has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys including his new replacement hes already resentful and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film so hes just kind of stuck with constantly brooding charlie meanwhile is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a mans worth his gift of the feature story and of the new york rangers was his way of compensating for not being a better skater he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey but he actively tries to put it behind him he wants his son to take the game more seriously but he wants his community to just get over it reynolds could have been good but sloppy writing andor editing keep walter in the corner and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together one character actually was interesting biebes wife mary mccormack like the judge understood that there was more to life than hockey but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open her unique insight is verbalized once and it lasts only a scene before it is gone but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom mysterty alaska follows a handful of other characters but none are well developed or worth mentioning the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story no underlying thing that the movie is really about instead roach and screenwriters david e kelley and sean obyrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy they try to make you laugh and cry to feel outrage and pride they present the framing and cadence for jokes but theres nothing truly funny they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness but they give you nothing to be really sad about as columnist molly ivins would say its all hat no cattle the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about there is a funeral scene played with appropriate gravity and somber music it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide whats truly important russell crowe steps forward to speak about to spell out the movies metaphor for us he says that what really matters in life is community then adds and hockey i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear only mildly bad mystery alaska probably deserves 2 stars i even laughed out loud genuine laughs in places but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers a friend of roach turned up in a role that didnt suit him myers is a comic character actor he puts on masks becomes an outrageous caricature and is funny hes great as austin powers dr evil or any of his scottish characters nobody else in mysterty alaska is a comic caricature all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semiserious roles for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast toward his audience and indeed toward the film itself its an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously 
a suave cool collected rich uptight bad guy cliche a clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs cliche a bad guy who owns a wild animal cliche a crooked chauvinistic law enforcer type cliche at an intense moment our main character tries to get away but the car has trouble starting cliche complaining about cliches cliche ok ok so we always hear about cliches but if there was ever to be a prime example the real mccoy is it not one uttered word not one frame of film not one character in this whole movie isnt a cut and paste example of everything weve ever seen they might as well use this as a training film how to make a bank robbery film in the 90s karen mccoy kim basinger is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a sixyear stay at the state prison she wants to make things right and go straight especially with the fact that she has a sixyear old son out there who doesnt even know shes alive aware of mccoys bank robbing expertise sniveling bad guy jack schmidt terence stamp uses the same sixyear old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier which by the way is somehow due to schmidt and if she refuses who knows what hell do to the kid cue sinister laughter this movie is so pathetically pitiful that its hard to know where to begin the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant i cant stress enough how every single element whether it be a character the dialogue a plot twist etc is so damn generic that youll wonder if anyone is working behind the scenes let alone in front of the camera basinger is absolutely vacant and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her heres someone that spent their time robbing banks and now as she heads onto the street were supposed to feel sorry for her as she confronts her son who doesnt even know who she is are we supposed to break into tears especially when neither basinger nor zach english who plays the kid has any depth or emotionalradiance whatsoever i suppose i should mention val kilmer yeah thats right hes in it quite sadly too seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name and he got second billing to be fair i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j t barker unfortunately the script doesnt allow much room for improvement and when his character is used like bookends he never shows up in the middle of the film we have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project the real mccoy just cant keep its head above water and soon very soon sinks into a cliched mess of movie the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer and the dialogue particularly schmidts trite dialogue falls like the niagra this is definitely one to avoid folks the real mccoy is anything but 
ironically one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes watching this sad excuse for a movie actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldnt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie not only is it a pathetically bad film overall but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video it is december 31 1981 and the big party is at monicas martha plimpton house but no one has arrived yet her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total strangers but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before nights end those who are invited are the ones that have the issues it is up to those who arent to help them come to terms first there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monicas and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland characters in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new years eve and tag along to the party with them they stumble across a nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future as he is in law school his lack of flaws is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the substandard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts val is monicas cousin and a true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just cant find paradoxically it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but arent successful who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movies creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performances and worst subplot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindys virginity the night before while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when a film is as putrid as this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts bad continuity and inaccuracies first and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other times objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots perhaps if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end but it didnt happen that way the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight 
1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood two movies dealing with the same subject or to be precise same high concept in summer 1994 that high concept was mad bomber action thriller in few weeks thrillride of the summer actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland where gaerity tommy lee jones ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material escapes from prison he comes to boston where he accidentally notices jimmy dove jeff bridges dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police few people except gaerity know the doves violent past when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror directed specifically at doves colleagues friends and relatives dove who is just going to retire and start family now must confront the mad bomber while speed doesnt even try to bother with plot and characters using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all screenplay by john bateer and john rice barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama the plot is of course full of implausibilities the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual no matter how brilliant he is can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay those questions same as in the case of speed could be forgotten while the action goes on but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters because of them movie seems a little bit too long and boring at times the most annoying element of the film however is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber his acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive the film have few bright points though some of the action scenes are fine which should be credited to director stephen hopkins predator ii judgement night and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of doves colleague but all in all blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous yet hardly unforgettable competitor 
dont get me wrong i tend to appreciate bessons naive unashamedly romantic worldview an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman and 1997s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love luv thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings but his joan of arc is a mess despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a closecropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself jovovich bessons own personal muse through the making of his last two films though theyve since separated is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior but also a fabulous supermodellevel babe and besson remains a servicable action film director though not an especially facile one leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english joans struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring and besson helps you understand how the french could believe fervently that god is on her side bessons big mistake i think is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject yes joan had visions but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blueeyed christ figure on display in bessons hallucinatory dream sequences the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman billed as the conscience shows up spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell babbling like ally mcbeal thats kind of a shame since she does quite well up to that point charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness that darkly attractive aspect of her character that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord is more or less betrayed by the final reels in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall as the story winds down with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance trouble is hes chosen a lurid often jokey tone for the balance of the picture including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is to a great extent nothing more than a puton this glib prefab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyers the passion of joan of arc 1928 a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joans trial and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema compared to that film the messenger plays as a crime against history directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich franceusa 1999 theatrical aspect ratio 2 35 1

its a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying osmosis jones is crude gross disgusting and was directed by the farrelly brothers the twisted siblings behind theres something about mary me myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt not that theres anything wrong with scatology i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor such as it was its merely that with osmosis jones the farrellys humor is too juvenile too predictable you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho the trouble is the animation may please the very young but the jokes may be over their heads while the teenage audience may find it too tame for their tastes adults well lets just say most will find it unappetizing osmosis jones plays like a 100minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby the live action sequences revolve around frank bill murray who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower frank much to the consternation of his daughter is a fastfood addict eating anything and everything that can kill you he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner and presumably smell better than he does franks body is invaded by thrax a lethal virus after frank eats a hardboiled egg that had fallen to the ground its not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth nope the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg wresting it from the primates mouth like i said the gross meter tips the scales on this one after ingesting the egg the movie begins its animated sequences here osmosis jones voiced by chris rock a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix voiced by frasiers david hyde pierce a 12hour painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne basically what we have is a cliched copbuddy movie rife with all the clich s of that genre and this is why osmosis jones doesnt click it merely falls back on tired familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations the jokes and puns are lame osmosis searches out a snitch a former flu virus after pumping him for information drix tells osmosis funny he doesnt look fluish and the jokes dont rise above that level the live action scenes are no better frank is such a slob so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child hes almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left the animation is rather twodimensional and flat it lacks scope and depth it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater 
has hollywood run out of interesting characters and plotdriven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching will smith and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs in enemy of the state that is exactly right a few parts the net and a few parts conspiracy theory enemy is about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997s lame brained men in black will this guy ever get a real role he has the bruce willis syndrome the plot is bascially smith playing a lawyer getting into hot water with some high government murderers who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie when a tape of the killing gets into his hands he inlists the help of an old conspirator hackman and at the end er you know enemy was one of the worst films of last year not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven and i didnt like how smith always magically outsmarted the badies when all the other extra characters seeming more intelligent than smith somehow got run over by a truck enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek insurrection i know these two films are different in well everything but the fact that enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me somehow quality cant overshadow quantity 
vegas vacation is the fourth film starring chevy chase and beverly dangelo as the heads of the hapless griswold family as with the other three films their two children rusty and audrey are played by a revolving series of actors this time ethan embry and marisol nichols fill the roles also back is cousin eddie randy quaid the slob relative who seems to bring problems wherever he goes in vegas vacation clark griswold chase decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen dangelo can renew their wedding vows it is at this point when comedy is supposed to ensue apparently the filmmakers thought that putting the griswolds into las vegas would be so funny on its own that they wouldnt bother to write any jokes into the script at least thats the way it looks when watching this turkey about half way through vegas vacation i began to have serious doubts as to whether there would actually be a single laugh in the entire film since there had been none up to that point by the end of the movie i had actually snickered a couple of times and i had smiled at a couple of gags i might add that none of the funny and i use the term loosely moments came as a result of anything chase dangelo or quaid were involved in they might as well have stayed home for as much as they contributed to this film the two best things in this movie were ethan embry and marisol nichols as the griswold kids who manage to have a couple of their own adventures rusty becomes a vegas high roller providing most of the films best moments every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film which brings me to the best moment of the film the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road the theme from the original vacation begins to play christie brinkley and her red ferrari also from the first movie drive by it was a cute moment but all it really did was remind me just how funny the first film had been and just how far that this series has fallen too bad 
burnt money is the perfect festival film it will show once or twice and then no one thankfully will ever have to hear from it again this film from the seattle international film festival 2001s emerging masters series is easily one of the years worst billed as a gay bonnie and clyde this gritty film from director marcelo pi eyro has its only highlight in a welldesigned title sequence two gay lovers get involved in a bank robbery that makes a gang leader whose plan they screwed up angry this causes the gang leader to send his boys out to get the gay guys one of whom may not actually be gay hiding out in a prostitutes apartment the two men must fight off police and gang members in a very long showdown for the movies conclusion if caught they risk losing all the money and their love as an added emotional bonus one of the gay men is dying or something like that everything that happens is so quick and confusing i was completely lost clarity isnt exactly this movies striving virtue so it was a little hard to pick up not much could have really happened though the main events in this long twohour film are explicit homosexual and heterosexual sex graphic drug use extreme violence and strong language lots of explicit material is never a bad thing when theres a reason but theres no purpose to anything in this film most of the sex and violence scenes come off as silly while the heavy drug use comes off as ridiculous and depressing it appears pi eyro who cowrote with marcelo figueras from a novel by ricardo piglia purposefully adds more blood and lovemaking for his own amusement he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible makes them snort cocaine gives them guns and condoms and lets them go burnt money is pointless the performances are bad it tries to thrill and shock but only causes boredom god forbid it will ever get a distributor another disappointing film from this years socalled emerging masters series pass on by 
claire danes giovanni ribisi and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists but theyre just about the only palatable element of the mod squad a lamebrained bigscreen version of the 70s tv show the story has all the originality of a block of wood well it would if you could decipher it the characters are all blank slates and scott silvers perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come by sheer force of talent the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever theyre on screen but the mod squad is just a secondrate action picture with a firstrate cast 
the haunting a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film to scare us if youve ever seen a movie which you probably have considering you are on this website you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film but the one i always like are the quot other namequot joke that try and rename a particular film for instance the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film small soldiers they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size well after seeing the haunting i had a few particular names for it as well unfortunately i can only post one of them otherwise id be getting some pretty angry emails from overprotective mothers that title would be the confusing ok that is a pretty bad title but it fits this film perfectly it basically serves up no purpose and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth the haunting is nothing but trash but unfortunately will still make a boatload of money before i rant and rave about how bad this film is let me point out the few and i stress the word few bright spots in this film first the house is great looking it looks beautiful but this is also a dark spot it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film things look so great that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie the hill house is not eerie it is beautiful but not the least bit frightening ever heard of lili taylor before this film i did not but i am glad that i do now she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film despite the dry dialogue and boringconfusing concept she manages to light up the screen every time she appears but unfortunately her costars are usually following right behind owen wilson who plays luke is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance other then taylor he is basically there for the comic relief and his character development is poor in all other areas all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped wilson had potential as luke but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs liam neeson and catherine zetajones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the hauntings coffin the plot is terrible the opening scene of the film is very important but the director makes it too obvious by getting closeups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film as i sat through the film i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish nell lili taylors character goes from the hunted to the savior it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any indepth information for instance the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program but we get zilch for the other four plus two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes and the worst part most horror films have killings for some reason they kill off luke at the end of the film no reason whatsoever just off with his head literally overall the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie bad plot confusing storyline and a waste of good talent hopefully liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential hopefully lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film and hopefully other horror films such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house will not be as bad as this one 
in 1989 director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama glory but since then he has made continuous disappointments to me at least with 1994s legends of the fall and 1996s courage under fire those two films werent bad just not very good but with zwicks latest film the siege he has finally made one the siege is a modernday actionthriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard denzel washington and frank haddad tony shalhoub who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it later a bomb goes off in a broadway theater killing even more they soon meet cia operative elise kraft annette bening who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist there are some movies that simply dont need to be made and the siege may very well be one of them oh sure zwick thinks he is making a meaningful action film since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than say die hard which also starred bruce willis this time willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u s army who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax whatever points the siege earnestly tried to make were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen or maybe zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical just as women were in the recent john caprenters vampires by placing them all in the category of bad guys the siege contains three fine actorswashington bening and shalhoubbut washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development bening has slightly more to do and has an intriguing character to work with while shalhoub pretty much steals the show even though again he has no real character by the climax of the siege with washington giving a sermon to willis on the socalled message of the story i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to on deadly ground in which steven seagal gave a 10minute speech at the end about preserving the environment the siege is constantly heavyhanded not entertaining or insightful and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay 
i guess that if a very wild bachelor party had gone really bad there would be broken furniture traces of smack and cocaine on the floor and a dead prostitute in the bathroom i guess that if a movie had also gone really bad there might be the same elements present coincidence poor kyle a meek looking jon favreau he is about to marry his radiant fiancee laura cameron diaz but before he exchanges his vows he embarks to las vegas with his friends for one last blowout but this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly get the prostitute has met a horrible though accidental death and drugs are everywhere the five friends agree that there is enough bad evidence here that will send them to jail for a very long time a surprisingly calm robert boyd christian slater who looks like he was groomed to make nefarious decisions ponders their dilemma for a few minutes before deciding that the best thing to do is to bury the body in the desert where shell never be found although they stomach the gruesome deed of getting rid of the body which also disturbingly involves dismantling the body using power saws in order to stuff it into suitcases when they return from their trip guilt and paranoia begins to set in which slowly consumes some of the five friends one is adam daniel stern he grows increasingly agitated whenever people look at his van or whenever a cop glances his way his blood pressure increases or that just may be because of his dysfunctional family another is michael who was actually responsible for her death he tries to bury his feelings but the burden of guilt begins to affect his judgment as well boyd is the doer of the group seemingly suffering from a long psychosis when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks kyle just hopes that his wedding will live up to lauras demanding expectations then theres moore leland orser who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face the problem with this reprehensible movie is that it wants to be a cruel comedy but it presents things in a manner that just arent funny drugs mutilation and killing your own friends isnt something to be laughed at as a straight psychological drama i could see how it might have worked as each one tried to maneuver and overcome the weight of their own guilt in their own sometimessick ways but this movie insults us by assuming that we could simply discard our values for 2 hours if you do like this movie i dont think that i want to know you i did find slater a convincing leader who sways his friends to choose not the right thing but the smart play and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a weddingneeding fiancee but her talents are essentially wasted here its obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film 
i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year when matthew perry had just signed on im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor and in addition i think chris farleys onedge extreme acting was a riot so naturally when the trailer for almost heroes hit theaters i almost jumped up and down a soda in hand the lights dimming i was ready to be blown away by farleys final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perrys big breakthrough i was ready to be just amazed for this to be among farleys best in spite of david spades absence i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran sadly none of this came to pass the humor is spotty at best with good moments and laughable oneliners few and far between perry and farley have no chemistry the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade for its his type of humor and not at all what perry is associated with and the movie tries to be smart a subject best left alone when its a farley flick the movie is a major dissapointment with only a few scenes worth a first look let alone a second perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie and not surprisingly the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley and farleys classic humor is widespread too almost heroes almost works but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot guys lets leave the exploring to lewis and clark huh stick to tommy boy and well all be friends 
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride and its sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the years finest films so naturally when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found this notion left me puzzled it is a rare thing for a childrens movie to be praised this highly so wouldnt you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly magical piece of work a tad bewildered but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind having great expectations for the film looking back i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater believe me i wanted to like babe pig in the city the plot seemed interesting enough after the events that took place in the original babe the sheeppig has become a legitimate national phenomenon but after a fateful encounter with a water well arthur hogget james cromwell who the movie could have used alot more of has been rendered bedridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially the only solution that his wife magda szubanski going from delightfully charming to downright annoying can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair i think and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public problem is the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded city a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion setting the main plot in motion mrs hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright here is where the film took a wrong turn up until this point i had being having a rather enjoyable experience the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs hogget is accused of smuggling drugs unfortunately the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel none of them being even onetenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe the main topic of discussion surrounding babe pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children and i believe it is at one point a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown at other times we are treated to surrealistic flashbacks to mrs hoggets full cavity search at the airport in fact the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing however that is as they say neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half let alone entertain a child another problem i found with the film was its sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story if youre going to make a darker and more sinister sequel fine it may not be my cup of tea but at least it is a noble ambition but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs hogget swinging from walltowall of a ballroom in elastic overalls it just didnt feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining and the same goes for the rest of the movie 
to put it bluntly ed wood would have been proud of this a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor hokey drama zero logic and a crap screenplay also a beautifully anticlimactic ending not to say it didnt look intriguing when i saw the previews so much for truth in advertising roland emmerich whos later independence day would look like the 400 blows compared to this cowrited and directed this inane scifi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens in a useless opening sequence men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it it wouldnt be till present day 94 till they would actually figure it out theyre decipherer a slightlyneurotic scientist nice twist dr dan jackson james spader doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare whos life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word why do they use him to decipher what no one else could so there is a hokey ending duh he figures it out in about a minute yea and then they get a suicidal colonel or something jack oneill kurt russel with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flattop that would make howie long snap into a fetal position why a suicidal colonel for the ending youll get the hang of this they open the stargate a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad after an overdone special effects thing theyre inside a goddam pyramid so they went to egypt right wrong theyre on another planet that was filmed in egypt they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra the sun god the androginous jaye davidson with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma and there are fights explosions and a kiss between two people yea also melodrama stupidity hokey scenes and a bizarre language an anticlimactic ending ends with stupid lines say hello to king tut asswhole the quintessential line lemme tell ya and some convenient pesudopseudopseudocharacter development by the end you just wanna go home and watch i dont know the outer limits or something the scripts terrible the special effects are okay but nothing great the storys so weak that its almost opaque the whole experience just isnt worth it unless youre so bored that youd consider watching a full house marathon or this id pick this obviously but still its just not fun at all and i cant wait for it to premier on mst3k 
i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick take the professional for example it boasts extremely glossy cinematography a couple of recognizable name actors and a couple of fairly impressive explosions its also basically about violence and cheap titilation and features a central relationship between a middleaged man and a twelveyearold girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension the professional is all over the map and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon jean reno brutally efficient but also very isolated one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door her name is matilda natalie portman and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d e a agent norman stansfield gary oldman after matildas father tried to rip him off leon reluctantly takes matilda in then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother the two become closer which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much and sets out to eliminate them both writerdirector luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita a slick potboiler about a female assassin there is no question that besson can make a great looking film with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast he has created a film chock full of moody closeups and evocative lighting but beneath the shiny wrapper there isnt nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits all intended to show us that for a hired killer hes really not so bad a guy he drinks lots of milk takes meticulous care of a potted plant and enjoys gene kelly movies jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality but she doesnt have too much to work with either besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag gary oldmans entire part is something of a cheap gag wildeyed and way over the top but at least he is interesting to watch there isnt a real person to be found anywhere in the professional which isnt always a problem in an action thriller except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelveyearold in a really distasteful way there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matildas relationship confront it head on or ignore it entirely but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that hes going to show them a forbidden love story while choosing simply to focus his camera on portmans rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol or the blood which is spilled aplenty a great deal of the time the professional is just plain sleazy and all the soft filters in the world cant disguise that fact

making your first feature film aint easy assemble a decent if not strong cast as writerdirector robert moresco has done with one eyed king and youre already ahead of the game but rehash old plot lines tired dialogue and standard clich s and a wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another but here we have it again five irish kids in nycs hells kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop with teary music and slow motion in the films first scene the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a goodhearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante id like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah blah blah but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points hes concerned about buddy jason gedricks heroin abuse he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwins characters sister he looks into who might be pushing the most moroniclooking counterfeit cash ever made a genuinely funny touch but none of this ever really amounts to anything it seems that morescos greater concern is to provide that intangible slice of life that flavor of the neighborhood that everyones been trying to evoke since scorseses early work so we get the drunk guys hugging and singing together at the local bar to prove to us that they really love each other do people actually do this we get a lot of tough street talk usually mumbled for effect and a whole lot of the fword whether it sounds like it fits or not we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose bruno kirby chazz palminteri you know guys youve seen in movies just like this one before assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears and baldwins performance is adequate but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that its almost funny moresco a theater guy and sometimes tv writer including the series falcone obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child but the content is probably too personal as a result the movies style is heavyhanded in need of a considerable amount of toning down nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids moresco reminds us boy does he remind us with slow dissolves to the earlier scene running in slow motion complete with dialogue from the present just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past moresco needs to either trust his audiences intelligence or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it his next project should have a little more personal distance and a lot more subtlety if he actually gets that chance reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage feature story coming soon 
whenever u s government starts meddling into other countries affairs under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political religious or ethnic persecution the other side is ready to use mantra that says look whos talking what have you done to the indians however even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes hollywood is just another example with its revisionist westerns made in early 1990s those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus discovery of america one of such examples is geronimo an american legend 1993 western directed by walter hill film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers the hero of the film is geronimo played by wes studi leader of apaches fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century when the movie begins in 1885 geronimo and his apaches made peace with u s government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation however broken promises injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless with not more 30 or so of his followers he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign general crook gene hackman commander of u s army forces respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 000 force isnt enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest instead he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches lt charles gatewood jason patric and indian hunter al sieber robert duvall together with young lt britton davis matt damon they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo geronimo an american legend like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors so the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people although such elements of john millius screenplay do indeed have some basis in history they harm the story of geronimo to be honest walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time instead they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band to make even worse hill has some real problems with pacing and style and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one story about geronimo and story about his pursuers the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimos life before and after his last uprising in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting wes studi cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans was perfect choice for geronimo not only because he resembles geronimo but because he induces a lot of passion in his role contrary to him we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies while this could be expected from someone like jason patric it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall even hills directing is bellow expectations battle scenes are too short and like in many of his late films force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s even his old associate music composer ry cooder disappoints with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic on the other hand photography by lloyd ahern ii with the use of red lenses gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic all in all compared with some of the hollywoods examples of political correctness this film isnt so bad but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better

 easely one of the worst films of the year with the millenium just around the corner hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil the result is somewhat predictable i didnt have high hopes about arnolds much anticipated return to the big screen schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased action lovers wont be bored and the catholic league will be angry everyone else will see end of days for what it is a deliciously bad motion picture think of it as hollywoods own y2k bug did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 youll get 999 as in 1999 yes you better believe it satan is here on earth working on his latest project the end of days this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and although not al pacino he is fun to behold he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker wreaking as they say havoc the way it works is he smirks and something explodes before the stroke of the new millennium hes got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations only schwarzeneggers cop attached to an antiterrorist unit can stop him films like this has one serious weakness logic no matter how you twist the plot youll find it incredibly stupid even for a schwartzenegger movie the incredible fact is that such directors never learn after thousands of headless productions this theme has become one big clich here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution he is walking around n y blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius all he wants is the girl that is somehow special but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks he has hidden her in a church where satan dare not enter so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information you can have your wife and daughter back i can give you happiness that you can only dream of just give me the address indeed with a script like that you could make a wonderful parody but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller and for you who have awaited arnold swartzeneggers comeback will not be very satisfied weve not seen him in a while thats because he didnt have a worthy opponent he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop so after all those fights whats left for arnold schwarzenegger how about satan in my opinion he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons terminator and that is schwartzeneggers strength muscles and no emotions here he tries to achieve an artistic level moving towards the oscar this is called an adult turn if successful and a flop if unsuccessful make a wild guess his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems this requires at least some acting skills regrettably the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters the movie is otherwise technically impressive with a solid cinematography and fine lighting but the movie doesnt serve neither as a serious thriller because of its stupidity nor as comic entertainment because of its serious tone the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody unless you are a diehard schwartzenegger fan stay away as for schwarzenegger hell be back 
these days people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off and now people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s few years in the future early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia however i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon 1 that in many ways symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry lack of originality and ideas being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series this film pairs two l a policemen jack colt emilio estevez burnout alcoholic cop on the edge and wes luger samuel l jackson bythebook policeman days away from retirement two of them following the murder of lugers ex partner must confront evil general mortars william shatner crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies the authors of this films whose director gene quintano worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects and that reflects in the lack plot characters and even original lines the plot or what goes for the plot in this movie is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years apart from lethal weapon series this film borrows its female lead from basic instinct the best gags are same as with many other similar movies shown in the trailers the rest simply doesnt work only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh others would probably wince at the lameness of humour some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while but at the end spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel 
paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what id consider a thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils starship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45 silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage its not a completely successful film but as a failure its certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the subculture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange havent yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop a bleak superhero satire with a robotic hero thats as touching as schwarzeneggers in t2 that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics its violence seemed to be there for a purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience theres a jawdropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victims every fearful tic its a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punknoir in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just wont shut up he impales a coworker drowns another and so on but why his character is introduced as a smug genius the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster the kind who just wont die hollow mans protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin whos saddled with the films worst lines ive lost cohesion again theyre a typical aaron spelling couple goodlooking but as vacant as george w bushs republican national convention speech i e bush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end to what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty doesnt look so absurd the rest of the films characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained oneliners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywoods new character developing technique ahh what a cynical time we live in as the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentations project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility for what purpose is never hinted at theyve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in a twist worthy of the films 1950s late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his coworkers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fxheavy complications then he inexplicably its hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human begins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear with each new release that its verhoevens films that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days its an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun thrillaminute ride verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self a couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in a serious manner to boot but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while fauxpsycho music strains in the background its plainly obvious that verhoeven isnt exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well its funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a womans naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks in fact its largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don inferred glasses that track his body heat as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy it happens when a lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted its a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer and theyre the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as a midweek bargain rental youve been warned but you probably wont listen will you tis a pity 
fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies but the quantity most of those movies were produced by cannon group company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman b movie mentors of future hollywood legends unfortunately that didnt happened and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal sadly for bronson that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead and lowering his own reputation in process on the other hand bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself one of such movies that seriously marred bronsons reputation is death wish 3 third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 in the original movie bronson played paul kersey mildmannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence that movie was far from masterpiece yet in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry unfortunately six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels even the presence of its original director didnt stop the rapid decline of the quality death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend living in the urban wasteland of east new york populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out before the reunion kerseys friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker played by gavan oherlihy probably the only noteworthy role in the film kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade while the police inspector shriker ed lauter ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime bronson the main asset in this movie plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine although bronsons charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower the lack of emotions or bronsons own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness so they added romantic interest for their hero public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kerseys crusade on the other hand emotions are much better played by confronting lawabiding yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey unfortunately michael winner doesnt know how to work out the plot and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations ends this movie with a bang the big showdown at the end that turns east new york into the sarajevolike battle zone is probably the worst part of the movie because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget in short this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia special note for trekkies marina sirtis the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife 
overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name based on shirley jacksons novel the haunting of hill house stars lili taylor as one of three lab rats that participate in a supposed insomnia study being initiated by liam neeson he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of creepy cgi effects scare the cast and try the audiences patience i know this question has been posed before but why do people keep remaking good movies the original was a great psychological horror film this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary in fact i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg13 horror movie that is scary unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening then theres nothing in this film that will raise hackles i nearly fell asleep twice during the film and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didnt seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed its sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability catherine zetajones always nice to look at is given the woefully underwritten role of a bisexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do finally poor lili taylor the center of the film gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her apparently a subplot involving a tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed thats too bad because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative this is jan de bonts second straight misfire speed 2 cruise control being the first when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything it would have served to make the film terrifying what our mind fashions on its own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything apparently yet another version of this story is being filmed under its original title i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bonts version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had pg13 
 tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately its not bad in the way great colossal misfires like heavens gate 1980 or ishtar 1987 were bad instead it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it was made in the first place with all the good scripts lying around hollywood unproduced how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history he has appeared in over forty films which have ranged from the very good 1984s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the apes down to the really bad 1981s tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these films were just cheapie bmovies made in the thirties and forties starring exolympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added a neverbeforeseen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the misguided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo dereks bare breasts tarzan and the lost city on the other hand has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come comic books have better plots than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summers comedy george of the jungle didnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tells of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie starts in 1913 he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week however when a wicked archeologistgraverobber named nigel ravens steve waddington begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africas last great secrets the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuses to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her apeman once the film gets going in its own sluggish way it delves into a series of jungle adventures as tarzan jane and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city most of the socalled adventures are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies ranging from raiders of the lost ark 1981 to the goonies 1985 when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeacefriendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusks into the river the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who was raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesnt even attempt to suck the venom out like any semiexperienced weekend backpacker would do instead he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one cant help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid when its sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isnt even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close this movie proves what starship troopers only hinted at he cannot act but he sure looks wellgroomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of a prettyboy to be an effective tarzan hes a calvin klein model in a loin cloth i also wondered what the makeup department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa1983 steve perry haircut waddington makes a decent villain although hes like a charmless version of belloq from raiders of the lost ark as jane the exmodel jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two but whenever a snake comes into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in ideas both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short 
everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence billy zane is wooden as the hero kristy swanson is given very little to do and does very little with it treat williams looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie only catherine zeta jones as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance she has energy and spunk which the movie needed much more of oh yeah the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you wont even care about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones and some colorful scenery however if youre looking for a fun family movie go watch the underrated flipper this is not a good movie 
a life less ordinary r while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided for this confused confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle producer andrew macdonald and screenwriter john hodge at the core of this strange film is a fairly basicand yes ordinarypremise after robert boyle regular ewan mcgregor an aspiring writer of trashy novels is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation he kidnaps navilles ian holm spoiled daughter celine cameron diaz and holds her for ransom the joke here is that celine is a willing victimher father threatened to cut her off financially so she wants revengeand that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping and ultimately didnt we see this one coming love so far so mediocre but mediocre is better than dreadful which this film is thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth so the chief of heavens police gabriel dan hedaya dispatches two angels oreilly holly hunter and jackson delroy lindo to earth to hook up celine and robertor lose their angel status this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film as it stands it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand not that there is much of a romance to begin with try as diaz and mcgregor may celine and robert are too onenote to become very endearing characters celine is rich bitch robert is a dullard as such it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these twothen again they never seem to really connect with each other when celine and robert start to overtly act on their feelings it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural but i am not exactly sure if boyle and companys point was romance honestly i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz but it remains just thatenergy not energy in service of a story or even acting the cast seems lost especially hunter whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film some violent confrontations involving the angels who are not exactly angelicin fact they end up staging their own ransom scheme some mystical hokum in the climax and a cutesy claymation epilogue watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell stockpiling quirks in the name of cool instead the film just gives quirky a bad name my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic yes misspelling intended whimsy which comes through in only one scene an extended musical number where celine and robert sing beyond the sea at a karaoke bar after a verse or two the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard just relying on the innate charm of the leads allowing them to build a romantic rapport alas not nearly enough is built for this moment comes to an abrupt end i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill a life less ordinary certainly delivers something different but by the time the film was over i was clamoring for a life more ordinary i can accept failure everyone fails at something but i cant accept not trying it doesnt matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart michael jordan 
how could a grated disney film based on meg cabots novel the princess diaries be anything but cute harmless fun easy take all the cute harmless fun out of it and while youre at it make it borrrring thats what director garry marshall screenwriter gina wendkos and not to be outdone producer whitney houston have done with the grated disney film the princess diaries you couldnt tell it from the audience though a braintree mass of growing glowing prepubescent girls and the odd parental popcorn perched about their persons who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddyduddy old me well i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over but that would have been too obvious too obvious is the least of the problems with marshalls film garry made a couple of other princess movies pretty woman and runaway bride but this ones way without julia roberts so maybe thats its problem in addition to being predictable as molasses the princess diaries has hardly got a laugh in it its a comedy could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long long stretches and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we havent even seen yet and probably never will except perhaps in the dvd edition marshall should take virtually all of the blame here since hes been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isnt working and hardly any of the princess diaries works works alas implies cleverness and theres none of that here either newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of the filmmakers go out of their way not to call it serbia which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words and now she mia is next in line to rule genovia hence the headphonestiara combo in the print ads julie andrews with the luminous factor cranked to 11 plays mias grandmother aka queen clarisse renaldi who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating talking and looking like a princess department although mias big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh not really consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock an evil cheerleader a dorkylooking best friend welcome to the dollhouse s heather matarazzo a sensitive auto mechanicmusician and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mias chauffeurdriven limousine at every intersection a nonanimated grated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts all the good stuff has been exorcised from the finished product lame labored and lamentable the princess diaries is recommended for eightandahalf year olds of the feminine persuasion only all others would do well to avoid it like potholes the plague and the perfect storm 
the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence its not abhorrent or even blatantly unlikable but it doesnt make a shred of sense and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film james foley knows a lot about characters and acting and those are the strengths of the corruptor but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train at least we have chow yunfat in the lead role chow plays nick chen a chinatown cop hes a good cop as the first few scenes establish and hes very familiar with chinatown thats probably why the powersthatbe decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace mark wahlberg nick and danny begin by stepping on each others toes but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other ones life what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me im fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu byron mann im also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ric young a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff im not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny although this makes for some ridiculous albeit unpredictable plot twists along the way theres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father brian cox but it doesnt have much to do with the main story one of the problems as i said is that the movie doesnt make any sense i dont blame this entirely on foley because hes obviously a good director im more inclined to point my finger at robert puccis script which doesnt seem to be in tune to the way normal people act one scene early on had me particularly annoyed nick confronts his boss because hes angry about his new white partner hes shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me in addition the film takes a bite into racerelated issues and never develops them at all there are a lot of scenes like this one and none of them are very coherent theres also a considerable language barrier given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents the plot itself never straightens out im not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are or why henry lee is associated with them or what they do as a group the corruptor is an action movie and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences the sequences arent bad but theyre not new how many car chases through chinatown have you seen on that note how many chinatown cop movies have you seen one too many id imagine foleys strength is clearly in characterization and he does a pretty good job here the scenes between nick and danny are very good and i actually got a feel for their characters a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together chow and wahlberg are both good actors chow is a pro and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere but hes still fun to watch i also liked the subplot involving dannys father brian coxs performance is powerful and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny but the film ultimately fails mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overlyfamiliar action scenes a complicated plot can be successful but the story needs to make sense when its over the corruptor never manages to make any sense it just keeps spinning out of control until finally theres nothing left to hold on to 
 return to horror high wants to be a couple different types of movies at once the film tells the story of a lowbudget horror movie being filmed at the closeddown crippen high a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before but what the cast and crew dont know is that a real killer maybe the same one that was never apprehended is going into action again on one level return to horror high is a slasher movie and it is at this level that it works the best on watching the film which was made in 1987 i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in scream and scream 2 on another level the film wants to be a slapstick comedy and there are many hints of this throughout unfortunately most of these jokes fall flat and the last thing the film wants to be is a behindthescenes look at an exploitation film being made the only problem is that while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made no cameras are shown filming it thus making it far more confusing than it had to be and to top it all off the twist ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through if you see the film or have seen it youll know what i mean the premise of return to horror high is admittedly pretty crafty and i liked the atmosphere of the school which is where the whole thing takes place but director froehlich judging from this movie is an incompetent director except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene well come to think of it there is only one scene that is actually scary and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in but other than that twominute distraction return to horror high is certainly no great shake note look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film and strangely enough he is the first character to get the ax literally 
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet vulnerable irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo played by sookyin lee as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild adam beach he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating ben gets emotionally involved with alessa as alessa so delicately puts it we were bosom buddies now were fuck buddies but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor the real problem with the film seems to be helen lees inability to decide what she wants to be saying she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients this appears to be a high profile and wellpaid job we are supposed to care about alessas feelings but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father alessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up doublezero i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale

seen december 2 1997 at 6 50 p m at the glenwood movieplex cinemas oneida ny theater 3 by myself for free free pass theater rating good seats sound and picture there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation watching flubber really clinched this idea for me because its just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality and how important it is to actually have a story the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted cartoony atmosphere we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard williams the typical supposedly likable mad scientist within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is phillips memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemers disease isnt this rather lowbrow comedy he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class an inappropriate joke for a kids movie if i ever saw one we learn he has stood his up fiancee sara harden twice at the altar simply because hes forgotten sara claims to love him but says if he forgets the wedding again shell stop loving him a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve and its no surprise the major conflicts here are related christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft a scientist who not only wants to steal phillips ideas but his woman too whats worse is that sara actually seems interested in him wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield which is going broke unless phillip can invent something to save the day one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced but is all but forgotten about thereafter its obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny unfortunately the flubber like all the special effects in this film looks very fake and unconvincing flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality and by the time it performs a song and dance routine you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy since phillips absentmindedness is forgotten about and somehow push the story along but its clear how weak this premise is from the getgo and the film just gets worse all the jokes involve people getting hit by fastmoving flubberpowered objects including bowling balls flying cars that dont fly well and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air its all presented with complete logic and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes during the basketball scene the coach for the rival team actually says i think they might be cheating to which the referee replies theres no rules about jumping too high predictable doesnt begin to describe the motions the film goes through especially after the halfway point and its not how terribly contrived the plot is its the way its broken down scenebyscene with absolutely no transition not only that but all the actors here especially williams seem bored to tears id say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen so its almost forgivable when you realize theyre talking to nothing and interacting with nothing its safe to say everything that could be bad about flubber is the only original element the film has is the worlds first romance between a machine and a human but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it and like the rest of the film you wont

for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood movie which are star vehicles are terrible things as a rule the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor an actor might be chosen on the upandup to give him exposure or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck generally though the actor doesnt matter and soldier the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers exemplifies this the picture lacks pizazz the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less russell plays todd a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought the movie lets us see this degenerate process but by the time the real plot starts were into todds later years hes about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers ones who instead of being trained from birth are genetically selected before birth the pride of this class caine 607 jason scott lee will be our villain and you know hes the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movies start between the two leads less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken and its possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction director paul anderson who helmed last years icy thriller event horizon doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam todd upon being replaced is left to die on a garbage planet but in order to stretch the running time out the villains return to the garbage planet on a routine patrol and set the stage for the final firefight events are predictable from the time that the setups are made and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be todd fails to show physical superiority against caine in fact not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry its not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit and treat it as a parody of typical action fare like universal soldier a strict interpretation however reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style class or substance and by next year a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television 
director doug ellins kissing a fool released earlier this year is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it the movie meanders along insulting the viewers intelligence in almost every frame the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines youve heard before im not wearing any underwear the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster max in what she assumes will be a surefire comeon line max chicagos biggest playboy decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam short for samantha max and sam possess two irritating personalities and they hold little chemistry for each other or the audience max is played without any style by david schwimmer schwimmer whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of personality makes an unlikely lover his costar mili avital as sam is cut from the same cloth so they can be argued to be a matched pair after all people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other ditto for similar looks so why shouldnt the personalitychallenged be attracted the implausible plot has max asking his best friend jay jason lee to hit on sam as a test jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him but stop short of the actual act max being promiscuous by nature worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work neither the script nor the actors make this test believable the 64 000 question is how do you know youre with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film finally there is the films attempt at physical comedy jays exgirlfriend natasha vanessa angel becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else natasha rips jays shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa as she throws her hair on his bare chest she demands he pull it this is supposed to be funny most films have some saving grace some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasnt kissing a fool on the other hand has nothing to recommend it kissing a fool runs 1 45 it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers 
i am continually amazed at movies like this that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mindboggeling but it seems to happen a lot nowadays wild wild west is a beautifully filmed well acted and well directed piece of garbage and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault in short this movie is a comedy without laughs so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco but its still pretty boring will smith stars as jim west an old western rb variation of the james bond character west is teamed up with artemus gordon kevin kline and theyre pretty much polar oppisites west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach talk about deeply developed characters at any rate this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies none of which are funny the year is 1869 several top scientists have been abducted and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general bloodbath mcgrath ted levine president grant sends west and gordon to investigate theres evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr arliss loveless kenneth branagh another disgruntled former confederate as it turns out loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon which he will use to conquer the united states id go further with the plot but there isnt any point this films narrative is little more than a jumbled unfunny mess i only laughed at a couple of jokes and then only lightly there isnt one truly uprorously funny moment in this film and thats pretty disasterous when you consider that its primarily a comedy as i said the fault is totally that of the script when you consider their respective roles will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done the leads couldve been played samuel l jackson and robert de niro and the film still wouldve been awful no one and i mean no one can make a line like bye bye mr knife guy sound good still this film has a lot going for it visually the set design is fantastic maybe even oscar worthy the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus who was also behind camera in martin scorseses brilliant goodfellas is absolutely stunning he lends the film a much needed exciting comic bookish look i wont fault barry sonnenfeld either he does a fine job of directing the proceedings but like the rest of the people involved with the film there really isnt anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw despite being beautifully made wild wild west becomes quite boring after the halfway point the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does if wild wild west didnt look so good it would be almost insufferable as it is its somewhat tolerable but not very entertaining it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low but there isnt anything much worse than an unfunny comedy 
this talky terriblyplotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux an exnew orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder mystery after a lightplane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat he and his wife annie kelly lynch rescue a little salvadorian girl samantha lagpacan from the wreckage and thats when the trouble begins the other major players include a local drug lord eric roberts his scheming wife teri hatcher a soused stripper mary stuart masterson and a shady dea agent vondie curtis hall everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective thats curious but never compelling based on the book by james lee burke heavens prisoners is so badly plotted that entire scenes seem to be missing early on we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa later dave is reunited with a drugabuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation huh the whole movie is like this perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf whatever the reason somebody should tell director phil joanou final analysis to recut this mess in its present form heavens prisoners runs only two hours plus change but it feels like four 
spoiled rich kid kelley morse chris klein receives a new mercedes for a graduation present he and his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town where he proceeds to torment the locals simply because hes rich and theyre not he ends up provoking jasper josh hartnett into a race and as a result the local gas station and diner are destroyed when they crash into it kelley is sentenced to rebuild the diner and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his familys barn jaspers girlfriend sam leelee sobieski soon takes a liking to kelley however despite the fact that 1 it was her familys diner that was destroyed and b all kelley does is sit around sulk and smart off to the townspeople but when she sees him sweaty and shirtless thats apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper whose only fault seems to be a perpetual case of hat hair so sobieski soon falls in love with kelley especially after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people in the speech kelley quotes a poem by robert frost which just so happens to be sams favorite poem as well awwwww soon theyre frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town especially jaspers best friend see them together kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town especially when he shows up at the town dance drunk and steaming because sam went with jasper kelley runs off and decides to leave town sam catches up to him at the bus station and he asks her to come to boston with him jasper shows up and tearfully confesses to sam just how much he loves her and sam without even breaking stride basically says see ya and takes off to boston with kelley here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around its completely worthless chris klein and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers and its because of their presence that i watched this film in the first place however not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film and strangle them both i shouldnt have such feelings towards people i like but their characters are so infuriating that well trust me youll feel the same way even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two simply because his jerkish actions are calculated he intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it jasper on the other hand only reacts to kelleys provocations and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions but as in life nice guys finish last for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the films only sympathetic character gets completely crushed then a cancer subplot comes into play where things get even more infuriating if you can imagine that what things werent depressing enough for you mr screenwriter who greenlit this project who on earth thought this would entertain anyone perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps felt some remorse after he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people but even after hes destroyed these peoples lives he continues to be a snob to them and ruins one more for good measure here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment it contains the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 85 1 and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions extras include jessica simpsons music video for where you are a commercial for the films soundtrack which by the way is the only good thing about the film the original theatrical trailer and five tv spots trailers for other fox releases anna and the king anywhere but here the beach drive me crazy ever after romeo juliet simply irresistible as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i really enjoy the picture and sound quality on the disc are fine nothing that will challenge anyones audiovideo systems of course fans of this movie if any exist should enjoy the dvd release here on earth is not entertaining nor is it compelling no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film it is merely a waste of time money and talent 
some movies prerelease buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when theyre finally released everyone just goes along with it thus sometimes films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations last year it was the thin red line this years winner is the hurricane pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool acclaimed director norman jewisons biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun and thats supposed to be ok because see its a true story its about rubin hurricane carter denzel washington a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly racist detective dan hedaya whos had it in for the bigshot hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife in selfdefense but who cares right when rubin was only ten he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison to the rescue lesra martin vicellous reon shannon and his team of wannabe detectives lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three welloff canadian white people hanna unger schreiber to get an education lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book the sixteenth round rubins autobiography immediately thereafter schreibers character tells lesra sometimes we dont pick the books we read they pick us hmmm after a few visits to the prison they become convinced of rubins innocence and launch their own fullscale investigation even though two juries have convicted him they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricanes innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings of course were already told that hes innocent a movie like this is especially frustrating because were not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life all too obviously were getting the hollywood watered down version that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it its almost cruel the melodrama isnt of the entertaining kind either its the hokey rammeddownyourthroat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudosaintliness of our four protagonists the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except its a nofrills courtroom movie its formula stripped to the bare necessities you have your wrongly accused black man you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene but theres nothing else youd expect some sort of involving investigation but thats not necessary since were implicitly informed of his innocence thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding brooding to himself brooding to other inmates brooding to lesra brooding to lesras canadian friends brooding in letters i dont think ill ever look at brooding the same way again it wasnt long before i got tired of hearing the hurricanes exceedingly deep meditations on his condition i wanted something to happen as for washingtons performance in the title role i figured id have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention its received he is top notch though still boring how is that possible well he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap what a waste of a great performer speaking of wastes why the hell did john hannah agree to do this hes an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly but what is he doing here to call his character along with schreibers and ungers a stick figure would be a gross understatement all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas as benevolent as dogooders come if theyre to play a major part in this movie why not make them real people with real feelings and emotions look if youre going to make a formula movie dont undermine the formula courtroom dramas can be fun but this is ridiculous not only is it trite its boring 
all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos please raise your hands thank you for identifying yourselves now would you all please go away your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade and it shows no sign of abating any time soon it isnt just the strobe light quality of your twentycutsperminute editing or the numbing overuse of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised featuring the music of no it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles welcome to the club scott kalvert your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and onedimensional serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole dicaprio stars as jim carroll the new york poetsongwriter performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based as the film opens jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey mark wahlberg pedro james madio and neutron patrick mcgaw one night jim graduates from inhalants to cocaine and shortly thereafter to heroin jims addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach bruno kirby kicked out of his home by his mother lorraine bracco and drops out of school along with mickey and pedro jim becomes a victim of the street living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carrolls posse resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic but now with equally unsympathetic friends as a film the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale a 100 minute long just say no public service announcement but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie but i suppose that his pseudosensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd without a character who changes in any appreciable way the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strungout cohorts all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack director scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing on only one occasion when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in are any of the gimmicks effective mostly they just draw attention to how hollow the story is they also dont allow leonardo dicaprios performance to be as strong as it could have been for every impressive moment like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an exjunkie who tries to help jim straighten out but kalvert wont let character interaction define this story he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting at isolate moments the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprios talents far more frequently it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like 
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen last man standing is either a a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas 1961 classic yojimbo b a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones 1964 classic a fistful of dollars c a prohibitionera action drama with a completely original storyline new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category c than in the other two combined much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the real source material the dashiell hammett novel red harvest it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself this time around the man with no name is played by bruce willis a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico by all appearances jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border one is headed by an irishman named doyle david patrick kelly the other is run by chicagoconnected italian mobster strozzi ned eisenberg calling himself john smith the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyles side but smiths allegiance is as uncertain as his name and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakescumbastardizations there is the happily ineffectual lawman bruce dern the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections karina lombard the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend william sanderson suspicious lieutenants christopher walken and michael imperioli to question the bosses trust in smith a brutal beating and a big fire director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity but at least he doesnt try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture what he does do is nearly as big a mistake and that is to provide a running voiceover narration by willis which rings of the standard hardboiled style of pulp detective fiction yes that narration is full of cliches but those are are not particularly troubling the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters they were a mystery to the other characters in the film and to the audience their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status with john smiths voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought he becomes more mundane just another tough guy trying to stay alive it feels like a hammett novel all right and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice but it simply doesnt work the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence and the man with no name takes no one into his confidence even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate i cant imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression with no compelling antagonist for smith there is no buildup towards the expected showdown and when it does come that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about cinematographer lloyd ahern who also did the only noteworthy work on hills 1995 flop wild bill creates some nifty sunburned vistas but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counterproductive narration sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original theyll wonder what all the talk was about in the case of last man standing it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about 
okay bear with me yall cause first off i have to get this off my chest what the hell is up with that damn crab whew okay cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end as cute as the crab maybe even i know that you need more footage than that and that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves the cutesy gimmicks saccharine sweet score soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar as amanda and sean patrick flannery as tom might have held some appeal during oh say the first 10 minutes of the movie at first the movie moves along at a quick interesting pace it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just doesnt die a ridiculous concept yes but at this point im willing to accept it because im willing to accept that this is how amandas life is changed how her powers are received later on the movie cant seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying they werent just repetitive they were out of place and unnecessary the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development amanda suddenly becoming a great chef her falling in love with tom etc sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good some places the plot just doesnt make sense sometimes its way too contrived the crab bit for example and sometimes too corny peaches emitting dry ice cant beat that all in all the plot seemed fragmented unconnected not romantic at all and only funny in some places so okay do the magic powers come from the crab or the fairy godfather she can float now too and all of a sudden instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches she can put her emotions into her food tom all of a sudden just accepts amandas witchcraft in the end would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupacs video what the hell is up with that damn crab it is unfortunate because i liked the basic premise of the movie until it became too fantastical and tiresome the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least a theme for a while but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables the humor was good in some places nolan gets the funniest bits including that incomprehensible totally random thing with the dolls gellar and flannery are qualified actors and gellar has a particular charm but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy or even annette in the upcoming cruel intentions than this sorry excuse for a character its almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible the supporting character nolan was a highlight though he reminded me a bit of kevin in youve got mail see footnotes and as always typical of a chick flick romantic comedy theres a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background cued up at all the right places this sort of got on the nerves after a while too simply irresistible is not hard to understand light funny in some places and generally disappointing because it cant draw the line between romance and protracted sap between humor and tired slapstick and how could i refrain from making a pun simply irresistible is all too easy to resist first viewing 2699 did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to youve got mail or the shop around the corner business rivals fall in love female counterparts business is in danger of being shut down female as mother like figure guiding her the annoying hysterical exgirlfriends i really like sarah michelle gellars wardrobe 
i went to blair witch project 2 book of shadows with the highest of hopes the original film released last summer was genuinely scary and terrifying i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor unfortunately my hopes were soon dashed as the movie opens the audience is shown pseudodocumentary clips of burkittsville maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie its a mostly humorous selfaware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist a young man who sells blair witchrelated memorabilia from his website the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarettesmoking doctor luridly leers above him we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scenes are barely referred to again i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes generally a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interiors and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie the movie cuts again this time to the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan as in the first movie the character names are identical to the actors names although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so theres no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website we meet tristen and steven a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience steven is a skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence she is wan and softspoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feels nauseated i knew immediately that the character was pregnant and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did i know because in bad movies nauseated women are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery kim is dressed completely in black has extreme gothstyle makeup on and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect its never explained the party of five heads off into the woods as promised they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parrs house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the nights events there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well but after a few words are exchanged the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down sexual innuendoes are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed and that steven and tristens manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds like snow the videotapes are missing but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tapes were found ooh spooky the team goes back to jeffreys house a creepy old civil warera warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird runelike burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes okay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie was awful simply awful the characters are broadlydrawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the natureloving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because shes pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wears a lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy because he has jagged teeth and talks like hes straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at its worst rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action it didnt work on top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie lets get on a plane home no i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out whats going on ok frankly by the end of the movie i was rooting for the witch i also felt that there was simply too much blood n gore in this film the first movie worked by never showing us the horror the witch was a palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror was all offscreen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the grossout this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffreys throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort knives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care this movie didnt stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything by the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours it is all explained in fact it is all shown onscreen in loving detail i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because i find the monster so terrifying but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind i found this to be a miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the directors intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so and if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall of manuscript paper hm blair witch 2 book of shadows was a horrible movie from the poorlywritten characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the grossout shots it was a bad effort through and through 
im giving this stinker normally the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive helped me come to the big goose egg im not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing or if he was even thinking at all maybe in mels little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny in mine its not or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking because only the selfrighteous lee uses the nword more often in his films than brooks did in this one at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it wrong mel i would call you a boob mel but that insults breasts everywhere this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors harvey korman attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out but the town appeals to the governor mel brooks in one of many uninspired and unfunny roles to send them a new sheriff to protect them the governor pawns the task off to kormans character hedley lamarr i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff gasp in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave hold on ive got to stop while these gales of laughter pass its just too funny racism passing as humor gosh why didnt anybody ever think of that one before oh wait i think somebody might have they are called the kkk im not calling brooks a racist but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldnt know what was funny if it hit him over the head but i digress anyway the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the nword golly will the hilarity just never end he ends up joining forces with a drunk gene wilder who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west together they save the day from evil not one person in this movie gives a decent performance wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie ok he really didnt but he should have the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions actually the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise but alas it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film 
2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways im not going into much greater detail than that since it would take forever to explain and quite frankly im not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that ive already wasted while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction 2 days in the valley falls way short this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello james spader and jeff daniels while the story isnt much and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots james spaders character while not much better than the rest is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron in her first role you know a movie isnt that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women even if they are both gorgeous i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about if i were to put a number on it only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent and even then prepare for disappointment not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again or at least not all of it anyway 
what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie a better question what would inspire a studio to produce said movie if you have an answer let me know foolish the new movie written by and starring master p is a jawdroppingly horrible film one with no redeeming value socially cinematically or otherwise comedically it has some potential but only in its standup comedy moments which i can turn on comedy central for master p stars as fifty dollah beat that as a mobster i think who is trying to start a comedy clubact with his little brother foolish eddie griffin but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss played by andrew dice clay for the very first time entertaining a stubborn club owner and family problems the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger eberts idiot plot if everyone here wasnt an idiot there would be no problem so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names not a hell of a lot as i have mentioned master p cannot act or write he acts like the rapper that he is the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro as for his script well i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience if you havent yet figured it out that is not saying much costar eddie griffin really the star of the show is quite a different story the fact of the matter is that griffin whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network is an extremely talented comedian standup and otherwise he has much in common with chris tucker rush hour money talks in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity to the extent which that can be done and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie and indeed i laughed at a few standup scenes here but from a featurelength movie i expect more foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers foolish blurts out towards his jewelrysporting sibling you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car to which i said a bit too loudly for the occasion huh after getting slightly upset with his wife believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hardearned 8 youll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you dont have cable eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative although offensive yarn but everyone else should stay the hell away 137 
synopsis a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary while his wife disapproves meanwhile a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession comments why is this movie called possessed by the night its hard to speculate most of this film takes place during the day and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky pulsating bubbling brain thingie in a jar in case you havent picked up on this yet possessed by the night is a bottomofthebarrel thriller i use the term thriller loosely here which is really cheap and bad the plot which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s actually serves one purpose to exploit nude women as often as possible writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging theres really not much to say the acting is lousy although occasionally the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience most humorous is frank sivero who plays murray the novelists agent he is so horrible in this role that one cant help but be amused the plot sucks nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole the dialogue stinks a loan shark for instance tells another how much he loves bimbos which is something the audience really doesnt need to know everything about possessed by the night is second rate even the film credits as the names of the notsotalented film crew scrolled by at the end joseph scales came up credited as being assistsant to foley artist someone could have used an editor to be honest the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes playboy playmate shannon tweed after all is the star here i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing he would like this movie why did i give this turkey two stars and not one as a bad movie it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night however id recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else 
okay okay maybe i wasnt in the mood to watch a mindless action movie i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii even while admitting that it wasnt as good as the others howewer the latest segal picture didnt look that bad and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash boy was i wrong in the first half of the movie we are already assaulted with segals acting he is not simply wooden he is like a wall gratuitous violence an incredible plot sexist and even more gratuitous nudity and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes by the end it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers not once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense of course in movies like these there must be a sidekick and a love interest in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model in the movie which only functions as a supposed comic relief by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie oh of course she appears naked from the waist up and of course segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship they did not even seem to be interested in each other i have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie often the villain saves the movie unfortunately the villains here are cartoonish stupid and unfunny unmenacing how many movies have psycho exspecial forces bad guys too many i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him the scene where we are shown the heros superiors are stupid the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand etc simply said this is moviemaking by the numbers boring and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience my recommendation if you go see it bring a watch youll be looking at it for most of the movie my rent die hard read a book stare at the sky do not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen once again dragged in by my friends which by the way liked the movie halfheartedly they probably like wrestling too 
in life eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison after about an hour of watching this movie you begin to realize how their characters feel fortunately for audience members theres a chance to escape the nearest exit this undoubtedly is eddie murphys worst movie and thats an accomplishment remember the golden child harlem nights compared to life they look like citizen kane life is long predictable foulmouthed and only intermittently funny its 100minute running time feels like 100 years robert ramsey and matthew stones script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as motherf s or n s you lose count how many times both those obnoxious offensive words are used and if that all it takes to write a script than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie but like life it will probably stink to be honest the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up but these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well life is as sophisticated as a belch its crude and stereotypical years ago movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient secondclass people good for being only maids and servants for the most part the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved but a new more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies in many recent films through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers blacks are presented as fasttalking conniving scam artists or hiphop guncrazy sexcrazed youths both sets of caricatures are demeaning and the fault does not rest with the actors they have to eat too it is with the people who write the scripts the studios who greenlight the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest lifes only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds otherwise life is an embarrassment a blot on the resumes of those associated with it see it at your own risk

therere so many things to criticize about i dont know where to start recommendation turn off your brain dont be like me decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much a comet is about to strike earth causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event e l e that wiped out the dinosaurs what follows is the story of a presidents bid to think for the good of his people a rising reporter the love story of two teenagers one of whom discovered the comet and a team of astronauts on the ship messiah to save the world firstly there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film nor is there anything outstandingly good about it but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid to be honest i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself which isnt saying much mimi leders followup to the peacemaker is equally incompetent with all the big stars wasted perhaps im just annoyed that the release of the peacemaker in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller the assignment it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives however the film simply fails on that note the effects are wornout the substandard screenplay limited the acting and the director continued her sad run in terms of goodfilmmaking credentials shes still making good money though t a leonis unfortunate character the news reporter is the foundation of the story and of the cast but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored robert duvalls aging astronaut is lifeless and morgan freemans president is restricted to well a righteous president which means hes not interesting at all leonis character is the only appealing one and is played with reasonable conviction but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters warning spoilers included but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway plot holes plot holes plot holes now e l e is threatening to exterminate more than 99 of the human race and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there wheres the logic leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish and those less selfish ones the ones that stayed at home were the victims the film was almost mocking them telling them they had died for nothing i also fail to see how two teenagers carrying a baby would be the first to climb up the mountainhill even with a motorbike for a headstart its unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle but that doesnt really matter building caves was a strategy mentioned in dr strangelove which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years now that is a more practical use for caves what is the point of living in caves there is no unlike dr strangelove any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure how do plants grow if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves theres no reason why they cant do it in the open the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago and you cant be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media in an important mission like that of the messiah for that matter any mission it is impossible that isnt sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres needless to say tens of kilometres this is not deep impact its a frivolous cheap impact but even with all that some overacting and a 3 4 rating its still watchable just dont think about it okay 
dont let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work and this movie makes a vain attempt at that any moves to glamorise his life which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness this movie about his life although well written puts too much makeup on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes rather than lobster and champagne oh well lets fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious playwrite who falls in love with a beautiful woman gwyneth paltrow and from her inspiration several plays develop romeo and juliet and the twelfth night it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and thats how all his plays develop but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama but i guess my version probably wouldnt draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul i think not as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie i think not in many aspects private ryan and life is beautiful were far superior movies but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar as time and again for reasons unexplained an undeserving movie will win the accolade another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead over a more polished cate but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised people will start feeling sorry for you 
its a good thing most animated scifi movies come from japan because titan a e is proof that hollywood doesnt have a clue how to do it i dont know what this film is supposed to be about from what i can tell its about a young man named kale whos one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and regenerating what is left of the human race thats a fine premise for an actionpacked scifi animated movie but theres no payoff the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil dredge aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights fistfights blaster fights and more doublecrosses than you can shake a stick at theres so much pointless scifi banter its too much to take the galaxy here is a total ripoff of the star wars universe the creators dont bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring despite the fantastic animation and special effects its just not an interesting movie

writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun harder than building a bridge over troubled waters and incidentally a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review thrillers are all variations on a theme you have a smart resourceful and powerful bad guy who has a goal he has to meet you have a noble and brave good guy who has to protect the innocent kill the bad guy and not get killed himself in the process the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest high noon or silence of the lambs or big summer blockbusters like men in black the fugitive or air force one or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds event horizon kull the conqueror is anyone else getting depressed here point is its not enough to follow the formula youve got to throw in something extra something good and new and better than the last version something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals this is a hard thing to do but it is absolutely necessary in every way without that something extra whether its a great plot or a wellwritten screenplay or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs the movie fails thats why the jackal with all its starpower with all its budget with all its hype gets a big fat f bruce willis is the bad guy the jackal a legendary killer for hire richard gere is the good guy a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal the jackal is trying to kill someone gere is trying to stop him will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ill give you three guesses and the first two dont count there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal no moment when you say to yourself i wonder what happens next the script for the jackal isnt ripped straight from todays headlines its ripped off straight from an episode of millennium throughout the movie we learn what the jackals plans are and how he intends to accomplish them no surprise the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackals plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy instead we get two count em two scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackals plan just as if hes frank black or more likely just as if hes been handed a copy of the script and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight its like geres character is psychic but neither he nor the fbi or the screenwriters seem to know it and just like in millennium the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about whether or not they are important to what hes trying to do or not whats more in the last half of the movie the jackal supposedly a supersmart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake comes down with a major case of the stupids as for the performances bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack which is a major achievement but not enough reason to see the movie his disguises are good but not as good or as interesting as val kilmers in the saint richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie not that his performance is bad or anything its not but it is sad that hollywood wont use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent shoot to kill sneakers writing a good plot and a good screenplay like i said is hard but it can be done it wasnt done here it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones do not go see this movie youll only encourage the producers to make more just like it instead stay home and rent day of the jackal or in the line of fire or a fire safety video for crying out loud anything other than the jackal which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other better movies 
all right all right we get the point despite all similarities to the bestselling story speechless is not based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin in fact the script was in development well before 1992 still the comparisons are inevitable until one realizes a critical difference no its not that the speechless twosome are speech writers not campaign managers its that carville and matalins story is actually interesting speechless is a limp poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign kevin is a sitcom writer brought in to punch up the republican candidates speeches while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer but there are plent of obstacles in the way including julias studreporter fiance christopher reeve and a series of stunts which continue to prove that alls fair in love and politics the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that theyre crazy about each other screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each others arms in the first fifteen minutes then developing the antagonism its a noble attempt to shake things up but unfortunately it just doesnt work part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do but in speechless they already know theyre attracted to each other and were left with waiting for the campaign to end so theyll admit that they love each other already there is such a herkyjerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue cant prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performances most of their scenes together the problems begin with their initial courtship which does virtually nothing to establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is a wiseass davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit in a couple of scenes like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection for the most part however theyre just actors spouting lines you keep waiting for a little spark and it never happens perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechlesss politics the setting seems perfect for a high energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix but thats never the tone that underwood is going for he wants a warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaimans fluteandwind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background it might as well have been a story about rival grocers and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert kings previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so i had some hopes for speechless but while there is wit in the words this is a script which was probably much better on paper on screen its still paper thin 
teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights wallets in hand the formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they don92t care to judge films92 quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times she has her own personal assistant unlimited supplies and her own office but she is very much dismayed with her position in life there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field where she can play a more active role in the chicago media so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jumps at it with elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gus john c reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter however since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves a high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them i don92t think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring so i won92t the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love stories between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage films it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still don92t recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rules comes the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two levels having some very black and white transitions and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic it is these qualities that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and as a central character he gets to take on his own miniplot which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed in a dazzling cherryonthesundae type piece of work he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit risky business never been kissed is a mediocre film at best the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception the acting is just as bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be a success because teenagers will pay to see any trash 
walken stars as a mobster who is kidnapped and held for ransom by four bratty rich kids it seems that a woman has also been kidnappedshe is the sister of one of them e t s henry thomas and the girlfriend of another flannery and the asking price is 2 million which said snots are unable to cough up alone they even cut off walkens finger to show they mean business because they are desperate to save the womans life suicide kings is a terrible film walken aside there isnt a single appealing cast member ofallon creates characters that are functional types without any resonance in an amusingly unironic scene walken plays poker with the foursome and describes each of their personalities to a teeits as if he was reading the summary sheet for a casting director the plot is another issue entirely ofallon is someone whom im betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster which is entirely unrelated to both the story and learys character or the numerous anecdotal sequences but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses by the fourth big revelationtwist i had completely tuned out wondering what on earth attracted these actors to the material recently a peer a fellow young filmmaker informed me that he had an idea for a movie about four guys the mob and the fbi it occurred to me then whats wrong with indies like suicide kings i suspect ofallon has never met a mobster is not a rich man doesnt deliver endless clever monologues to his friends about his favourite types of boots in short these guys are just riffing on other movies and in doing that making the same film over and over and over again tarantino found his niche and now hundreds of genxers with movie cameras are trying to find tarantinos niche instead of carving their own reviewed at the toronto international film festival 
from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong at reagan high four girls are sitting on top of the world courtney shane played by rose mcgowan holds the title of meanest most disrespectful soul in the school everyone hates her but everyone envies her due to her popularity courtney is the leader of her clique which also includes julie played by rebecca gayheart liz purr played by charlotte roldan and marcie played by julie benz are the other three in the group it is lizs seventeenth birthday and julie courtney and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her but the prank results in the death of liz just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else and also just like in other teen directed movies one of the four dont agree with hiding it this time that character being julie and finally just like in other teen movies there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth this time that character being fern mayo judy greer who is subject to many cracks from courtneys group as well as the entire school from here jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge bad morals and at least trying to do the right thing not only is the script weak on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional annoying character as she overacts every line she has also on the bad side of acting is julie benz almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers on the positive side of acting rose mcgowan performs well here but doesnt match her wickedly clever performance as tatum in 1996s scream mcgowans role is annoying but this only adds to the film she is wickedly mean and even though she a wellwritten character you downright hate her faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart who is always exceptionally believable as her roles when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character she turns it into three always putting strong emotion and power into her roles gayheart isnt given as much to do here as she was in 1998s urban legend but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident and get into things that dont have anything to do with the actual film the beginning and ending are strong its just the middle that needs a lot of help during the body of the movie it is undeniably repetitive never progressing towards a conclusion nothing to grab the viewers interest is around and the same extremely annoying song plays over and over again jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless but falls flat the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang all in all a horrible disappointment the bottom line the tagline reads even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside yes that is too true no matter how good this film may have looked it fails to deliver 
well there goes another one sadly this like other movies this year wasnt good this one being almost as bad as the omega code but not quite from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad and well i guess i was right with bad excuses for acting a horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is a terribly unfunny movie that doesnt work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best the movie is troubled from the start because chris odonnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date here is the stupid plot chris odonnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend he meets anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three years jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up he really doesnt realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her what he wants i never did catch so he proposes in a really bad way and she shoots him down and is very mad he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars as long as he marries before the next day at 6 05 pm now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an unfunny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs even the supporting roles of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser arent even good the plot was a good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing dont help things any even though chris odonnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming sweet and likable performance as usual and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a bigheaded mogul who after a while became routine and old one really cant help but think that we have seen this stuff before its not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness the bachelor works on no good levels and in fact doesnt work at all ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris odonnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal he seems held back and really doesnt get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and unnerving why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success and sometimes i dont agree with other critics on movies even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts its based on the 1925 silent film seven chances which i am sure is very better than this mess even though some may think of this as a good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being a terrible movie the bachelor is well a terrible movie it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really cant recommend this movie i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time being one of the worst movies of the year we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies and if they do they i give up on filmmakers 
my inner flag was at halfmast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet reruns off the air sure id seen them all at least once but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultraserious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb antifans still have the d i a 50s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous blue boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness think of the d i as what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he plays exactly the same character here a nononsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long winded melodramatic speeches on any topic in this election year im more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webbs office door and enters he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much goes without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason i was wondering if there would even be a plot i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants but the d i gives us more much more webbs mission is to make a man out of private owens the local screwup the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself whether the lace panties part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered this of course gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens life a living hell for those of you who havent been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching heres a reprint of a typical monologue of his i cant duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the words should at least partially convey what im talking about now you listen to me youngster someday youll wake up fighting on a beach and youll pray to god somebody doesnt get killed because of your foolishness ive got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours youre gonna turn around and ill be standing right there i couldnt write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard days work by going to the local bar where he orders a tomato juice he meets a woman who coincidentally also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typicallystimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his archrival another marine d i webb marches over to the table gets up in her face and says just what kind of a dame do you think you are bogart he aint the other d i gets one of the few memorable nonwebb lines when he confesses to the girl hes a damn good d i i guess im just a little jealous join the club were all jealous of jack webbs way with women which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment a lingerie store and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display you expect me to talk to you in here he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras the woman goes off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen a little girl spots him in the store and demands what are you doing in here youre a man arent you he doesnt reply but you know hes thinking in his head what an odd species of human so small must be one of those children everyones been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversions hes responsible for the movie doesnt focus too closely on webbs romance it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owens was that flea you killed a male or female owens replies a male sir webb yells to the platoon this aint the one that such a scene along with the rest of the movie was intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie with the exception of owens were played by actual marines someone wanting to parody this movie couldnt do a more comical job than webb did it makes it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself theres a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter webb bursts in the room and shouts what did i tell you about laughing to which the private replies sir only nineyearold girls laugh sir and let me tell you i was as happy as a nineyear old girl while watching this movie

theres only one presidential election every four years but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as the thriller of the year in 1997 weve had absolute power air force one shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 this one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford trying to bring us a complex plot of coverup and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys heres what happens this time its night at the white house a secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt the next day shes dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in how do we know hes a hotshot weve seen the traditional action flick opener the clever hostage negotiation scene its not so clever this time consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal exgovernment employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street snipes is off to the white house where he finds the secret service head the shiny bald head of daniel benzali wont cooperate with him at all in fact if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda snipes wouldnt have been allowed in the white house at all alda helps snipes out further assigning a sexy secret service agent diane lane to act as his liaison a very dangerous liaison well not really i just wanted to say that almost immediately a suspect is found an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos snipes doesnt buy it and launches into an independent investigation of his own one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the presidents son snipes partner an always wisecracking dennis miller calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane who at first doesnt believe snipes eventually and predictably comes around and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information for the first hour or so murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting sure we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon snipes and lane dont make for a bad action team but with nothing to work with theyre just cogs in the bad movie machine dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood and thats saying a lot when you get to the last halfhour the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer busting out the old breakintothebuilding underground climax and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why youll wish you never sat through this movie at all the 1600 in the movies title doesnt represent an address it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide serving the world for nearly 125th of a century 
ah and 1999 was going along so well too shes all that has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie ive seen so far this year and quite frankly i doubt ill see anything equally bad at least i hope i dont see anything equally bad shes all that tells the story of the most popular guy in school played by freddie prinze jr who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school rachel leigh cook into the most popular that right there is problem 1 how many times have we seen this storyline as cook comments near the end of the film its kind of like pretty woman except without the prostitution of course had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material the wellworn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward as it is though shes all that relies completely on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead theres not one original or interesting character in the film either and if that wasnt bad enough theres not one good performance featured the star of the movie rachel leigh cook is simply horrible i usually dont like to get so personal but in this case i think it needs to be said cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was i was never convinced that she was a nerd and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary the movie seems to be saying its better to be popular than to be who you are as for freddie prinze jr an actor i ordinarily enjoy he too is quite bad here he coasts through the film on socalled charm and never establishes a real character kieren culkin is here too as the brother of cook and for some indiscernable reason hes got hearing aids no explanation is given and theyre never brought up were we supposed to feel sorry for him just because he wore hearing aids i dont think so that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things ive seen in a movie in a long time shes all that sucks thats what it boils down to its not entertaining and its not even a good time passer the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hairremoval system informercial and whats worse it sends out a bad message to teens it appears to be telling them hey it doesnt matter if youre happy the way you are thats unimportant if you want to truly be happy dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubbleheaded moron ugh 
michael robbins hardball is quite the cinematic achievement in about two hours we get a glancing examination of ghetto life a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy speeches about never giving up a cache of cute kids including a fat one with asthma a hardluck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic big game where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined all thats needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich s i cant wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd obviously hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam out of solutions he begs his successful corporate friend the always welcome mike mcglone to lend him 5 000 instead mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend reeves who wants to keep his fingers accepts the offer but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely the drowsyvoiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs and maybe just maybe theyll play in the big championship game one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins summer catch adapted from daniel coyles nonfiction book is that there arent any the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie that wouldnt be so bad if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them most of the kids time is spent yelling at each other talking in slang and acting surprised theres little thats naturally amusing about them as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling the worst of the lot is a toughtalking younger player dewayne warren whose sole purpose as the movie unfolds is being an emotional pawn a tactic so utterly despicable i cant find the right words to express myself the adults also dont fare well reeves is impressively uninspiring as the downonhisluck loser the character is poorly written but reeves gives another charismafree performance every time he speaks he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up kids are supposed to rally around this guy diane lane who costars as reeves obligatory love interest remains a glowing screen presence see my dog skip for better proof its too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like these kids trust you and they dont trust anyone then theres d b sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters youve seen before and hope never to see again i wanted hardball to be good robbins varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved i havent seen robbins goofy ready to rumble in its entirety but i am intrigued that macho man randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte making sports movies for guys and not cutesy cuddly pap such as hardball which also manages to annoy and insult the audience heres hoping that happens in the immediate future 
you know something christmas is not about presents its about overhyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tieins at least that would seem to be the message of the grinch which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season you know the plot theres this evil furry green guy called the grinch jim carrey who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas the movie is of course a liveaction version of the beloved childrens book which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones its rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirtyyearold halfhour cartoon but thats the case when jones version is compared to ron howards the tv grinch hit all the right notes boris karloffs soft deep narration thurl ravenscroft singing mr grinch max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head and the grinchs wide toothless grin by contrast the movie hits one sour note after another first there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105minute movie young wideeyed cindy lou who taylor momsen is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents bill irwin and molly shannon during the holiday season she begins to sympathize with the grinch who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class martha may whovier played as an adult by christine baranski are we expected to like the grinch hate the whos and want him to steal christmas the grinch isnt even the villain here that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville jeffrey tambor who was the grinchs rival for marthas affection not only are the characters needlessly complex but the oncesimple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought the casting choices arent any better than the screenwriting decisions jim carrey seems woefully miscast while his face is so supple that the rubber makeup seems superfluous carrey brings nothing else to the role his accent keeps changing i assume he was shooting for karloff but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon sean connery and cartman from south park not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinchs home carrey falls back on his standup comedy and clowns around ace venturastyle needless to say his wisecracking antics dont quite fit the character of the grinch who is an embittered loner filled with hate little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story finding santa in her living room stealing the tree however the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch and momsen is not up to the challenge bottom line when youre stealing christmas movies leave this one behind 
in the mid1980s following the splendid debut in hugh hudsons greystoke and relative success of first highlander film it looked like christopher lamberts acting career might go somewhere but it wasnt meant to be which became obvious following highlander ii in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality very often such films were science fiction which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert whether it was because of real lack of talent terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isnt important the end result was almost always horrible the same can be said for fortress 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond the movie is set in 2018 for some undisclosed reason usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child jake christopher lambert and karen brennick lori laughlin broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border sentenced to 31 years in prison they are both thrown into fortress privately owned correctional facility equiped with stateoftheart futuristic technology and run by computer called zed although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates lives and make any escape impossible prison authorities often use violence jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape such escape should become necessity because the warden poe kurtwood smith begins showing unhealthy interest in karen after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich s and situations that are painfully predictable by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress those situations not only begin to look predictable but utterly implausible too of course film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultraexpensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters played by not too interested or talented actors lori laughlin although physically attractive shows the acting ability of sequoia kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired capable of solid yet forgettable performance lamberts performance is also good but even the bigger talent couldnt help this film destined to end in oblivion 
susan grangers review of the musketeer universal pictures hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this 50 million adaptation of alexandre dumass novel thats strong on action but weak on drama fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing dartagnan justin chambers as he leaves his village of gascogne headed for paris to join king louis xiiis elite guard the royal musketeers and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre tim roth vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu stephen rea the traditional musketeer trio aramis nick moran athos jan gregor kremp and porthos steve speirs dont offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca mena suvari chambermaid to the queen of france catherine deneuve scripter gene quintano and directorcinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derringdo as evidenced by choreographer xinxin xiongs elaborate but not original stunts including a fastpaced stagecoach chase a tavern brawl on rolling barrels highwire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes and a ladderfight sequence filmed in southern france the scenery sets and costumes are spectacular but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy restless mtvish cuts as the swashbuckling dartagnan bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing totally lacking onscreen charisma not to mention acting skill mena suvari so impressive in american beauty seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 the musketeer is a cinematic but shallow 3 all for one and one for all not this time round 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere this highlyanticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to a less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last years case study in style over substance joel schumachers muchloathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes uma thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuitclad karatechopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same cant be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade doubleentendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that theyre on board a sinking ship at this rate usuallysplendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days the duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but theyre no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spoton english accent if nothing else itd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such as it is involves the everbemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climatecontrolling contraption they also sip a lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant postproduction tinkering its clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds the avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac its all decidedly uncompelling mr connery whos onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all looks good this is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates by the time the films climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year its everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining a crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but i sure hope not 
stallone attempts to act in this cop drama the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal whos nephew played by michael rappaport is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths keital dosent really want to get involved in anything gets rid of rappaport and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on this film should be brilliant it sounds like a great plot the actors are first grade and the supporting cast is good aswell and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance however it cant hold up although the acting is fantastic even stallone isnt bad the directing and story is dull and long winded some scenes go on for too long with nothing really happening in them in fact the only scenes that do work are action scenes which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid in this film serious means dull the dialogue is warbling and basically just repeats the same points over and over no matter who is delivering them the plot which has potential is wasted again just being cliched after a while in fact the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro both delivering their usual good performances however stallone although not given much to say gives a good performance however its not all that bad as said above the action scenes are well done theres also a very good ending which uses the cinemas sound system well in fact the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 if only the rest of the film was as good as the ending cop land then turns out not to be a power house film but a rather dull and not every exciting film hugely disappointing and i cant really recommend it 
the first species was a moderatelysuccessful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects a few well paced action sequences and frequent views of modelturnedactress natasha henstridge sans clothing however it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel and considering the quality of species 2 its obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is if you throw away the plot which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence logic coherence and consistency species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience of course that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys who at least in theory shouldnt be able to get into an r rated film and connoisseurs of bad movies theres enough blood gore simulated sex and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring this is a grade z exploitation flick thats ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment somewhere someplace i recall hearing species 2 described as erotic i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie because he or she has a peculiar notion of eroticism sure theres a lot of sex and nudity but its almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a womans abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free splattering blood and gore in all directions anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge and to get the obvious question out of the way yes she does remove her top but only once and only briefly although the character she played in the original species is dead government scientists still have the dna and out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse they decide to create another clone this creature dubbed eve by its creator dr laura baker played by marg helgenberger reprising her role is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile meanwhile man has finally set foot on mars a team of three led by patrick ross justin lazard has traveled to the red planet but when they return to earth they bring something with them ross has become a halfhumanhalfalien hybrid and hes soon mating like crazy collecting the bloodsoaked children that are the result of each sex session his intention is obviously world domination standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film preston lennox michael madsen and one of patricks fellow astronauts dennis gamble mykelti williamson but when patrick learns about eve a female of his kind theres no damping his ardor im not sure what the budget for species 2 was but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors as opposed to being diverted into the special effects michael madsen and marg helgenberger both back for a second round are clearly on hand to do as little as they can grab the money and run ditto for james cromwell who plays patricks father underused is too kind a word to describe his involvement invisible would be more like it george dzundza gets to do a little scenery chewing as an angrybutinept general meanwhile justin lazards performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridges limited abilities look good by comparison the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick complete with cheesy special effects bare breasts around every narrative corner and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics director peter medak a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume has added another forgettable title but at least he appears to have had fun doing it which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness do i recommend the movie absolutely not but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didnt try my patience to the degree that some pseudointellectual bad movies do heres hoping theres no species 3 
a number of critics have decided that its open season on freddie prize jr slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in soundalike disposable teen fluff like head over heels boys and girls down to you and shes all that while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend his talent is not i first saw him in the independent dark comedy the house of yes where he gave a subtle impressive performance as the younger brother in one of americas freakiest families prinze has the acting chops he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grownup movies to show the nonbelievers that he has what it takes summer catch certainly wont help his case inoffensive but utterly generic the baseballrelated romantic comedy does little more than kill time the story deals with the love affair between tenley jessica biel a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan prinze a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a bigtime baseball star ryans preoccupation with his new honeybunny drives her elitist father bruce davison crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team its a wonder the kid has any time to pitch as his time is occupied with making out with tenley fighting with her dad bonding with his own dad fred ward who deserves better than this fighting with his brother jason gedrick and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky characterheavy baseball movie like bull durham but havent got a clue how to get there and so they glide from one clich to the next for 108 minutes the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a centerfielder from texas in an early barroom scene blucas best known as demonfighting riley finn from buffy the vampire slayer hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states he does have a nice ass a bubble butt when lillard gives him an are you insane look blucas calmly says its nothing sexual then goes on to evaluate the hindends of some other players including lillards speaking of asses prinze does not bare his in the movie the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract so two stuntbutts were employed for a couple of seminude shots blucas whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story gets another unique moment late in the film sick of hearing teammates make fat chick jokes he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amplysized ladies while his speech still ends up objectifying women it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie trivial tidbit summer catch marks a scooby doo summit marc blucas appears in jay and silent bob strike back as fred from the scooby doo gang while freddie prinze jr plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon 
everybody in this films thinking of alicia no this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the cryin video this is one of those erotic thrillers but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed first off theres zero sex almost no nudity and its not as wellplotted as one of those tweed flicks well anyway the plot alicia plays well the babysitter who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents j t walsh and lee garlington go out to a party the film trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers shows every characters thoughts except alicias the thing is alicias in most of them in most cases and the thoughts arent too kosher first off theres her boyfriend jeremy london who gave one of the alltime lousy performances in mallrats and is only a notch better here whos a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully played by nicky katt from suburbia who shows hes got that quiet creepiness down pat once again they decide they want to crash her babysitting job looking for the typical babysitting hankypanky somethine like that the film intercuts between the subplots alicia babysitting nicky and jeremy the party and each characters thoughts we get to see jeremy and nickys dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia j t thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub she has it all covered up the little tease and worst of all lee garlington dreaming of that hunk george segal it even shows them in bed together yea i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed though i guess im used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in flirting with disaster the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing but come on like we care about any of the characters the only interesting one is alicia mainly because shes alicia and we mostly see her in the fantasies so i guess shes some kind of mystery or something but she is never explored further so basically this film is just a series of mastabatory images sometimes featuring a nonnude alicia once again sadly sometimes featuring a scantilyclad george segal once again sadly i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night and let me tell you it is the only way to watch this film i mean theres a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night theyre just as good as sleeping pills and this one is one big fat waste of time even for an alicia film

august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniels screenplay george lucas producers rick mccallum runtime 131 min us distribution 20th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic elements copyright 1999 nathaniel r atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review ive attempted to obey this rule in recent months but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity as a child they are masterful original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release but that doesnt make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star wars trilogy and the empire strikes back in particular are three items on a very short list of why i love movies when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series i got exited when i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a yearlong drool of anticipation and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving i was ready to see the film but then there was the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilms secretive snobbery over the picture in the last weeks before the picture opened while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater i was tired of hearing about it i was tired of seeing cardboard cutouts of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell i just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand i did not have an antihype reaction the hype was unavoidable i understand and accept the hype its just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released five minutes into the phantom menace i knew there was a problem who are these jedi knights i asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machinegun rapidity why arent these characters being developed before their adventures why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my questions early on later i asked wheres the magic of the first three films and why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes by the end of the film i was tired maddened and depressed george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star wars film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and youre left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time its an embarrassment i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effects shot isnt used there are a few of each but theyre all token attempts the fact is george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects this is not what i wanted to see i didnt want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did the story centers mostly around quigon jinn liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely has a line in the film and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people after picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august quigon knows that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters there isnt anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas has handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we dont learn one single thing about quigon jinn not one thing what was his life like before this film well i imagine he didnt have one thats why he feels like a plot device this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role and why hes recently retired from film i dont blame him honestly obiwan a character i was really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor has just a few lines so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshedout character in the film and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin says goodbye to his mother i found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters ive ever had to endure but hes more interesting than most of the humans as soon as the relativelybrief segment on tatooine is over its back to the mindnumbing special effects and depthless action scenes ive seen many movies that qualify as special effects extravaganzas but the phantom menace is the first one ive seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas has no restraint i cant say that i didnt find the effects original because i did the final battle between darth maul obiwan and quigon is visually exceptional as is most of the film but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome my breaking point was near the end of the picture as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters in the background we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away cant we have one stinking scene that isnt bursting at the seems with a special effects shot i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours and then theres the question of magic what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction i think it comes right down to characters there are none here i longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectations mine werent that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects instead i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show i dont hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it id like to forget that it exists and yet i cant its here to stay i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they dont then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series 
the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic finding an allstar cast for such a film is a stroke of genius combining all that with a threetime oscarwinning director robert benton of kramer vs kramer and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood how many of these have we seen during the past few years the atmosphere is moody the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere over70 harry ross paul newman is a washed up copturnedprivate eyeturned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life hes screwed up things pretty well i had a wife and daughter now im a drunk and is at a crossroads a couple of years ago he traveled to mexico to bring back mel reese witherspoon the underage daughter of jack gene hackman and catherine susan sarandon ames and now lives with them the ames are former movie stars past their prime and the three have become fast friends one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up to fill his time he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine jack is in even worse shape than harry hes dying of cancer with only a year to live things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him instead of the routine errand that ross expects he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another excop who is himself full of bloody holes this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherines first husband 20 years before through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder blackmail guns mels mexico traveling partner and his parole officer rosss former cop buddies exlover and wouldbe sidekick the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to its a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario by the time they show you it doesnt matter the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in rosss relationship with rubin giancarlo esposito a partner wannabe these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief however they are neither rubin and ross have some past relationship but either its not explained or i didnt care enough at that point to remember a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform its also not funny doesnt connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course on the positive side its often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen the three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished if not extraordinary jobs newman is a grand actor but doesnt seem quite suited to the dark film style he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out hackman also lowkey is believable but lacks sparkle sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is onedimensional the actors do what they can with lame dialog but they cant pull the film out of the hole its dug for itself james garner who plays rosss old buddy excop raymond hope is always a treat but even he halfheartedly struggles through lines like im glad they didnt shoot your pecker off the best part of the film is the look at old friends how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesnt run very long before the audience realizes that its hopeless the only reason for watching is the actors it reminds me of disaster movies such as towering inferno where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the films problems in a better world there would have been secondrate actors in this secondrate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better of course we dont live in that better world but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie 
martial arts master steven seagal not to mention director has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights talks in a hushed tone and squints at any sign of danger hes also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movies suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art that is martial art im sure the guys good and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows although a tad haughty but these movies he makes are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses although i kinda liked under siege of course this one as a change has a message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people so why do i watch his crap i usually dont i will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this mans movies unless and only unless hes in a supporting role i e executive decision and id definitely pay if he dies i e executive decision but this one has a special place in my heart this doesnt mean its good or that i even liked it this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre 3000 and this was a couple years before i had heard of mystery science theatre 3000 in this one seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greasedup typical shallow villain this time played by an oscarwinner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the 2030 minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine has him bumped off or does he seagal is rescued by some inuits and falls in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caines cliched henchmen played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoots the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesnt have any options but blow stuff up he even goes as far as to say i dont want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is i have no problem with violence im a huge john woo fan but he paints his films with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the films of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some points they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain has the advantage can shoot seagal but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal says something hokey back and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and does this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didnt take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summers con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message i wouldnt mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewers mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we cant take him and his motives seriously and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig and kills some workers who were just doing his job then at the end he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech just in case you didnt get the message from the trailers what seagal doesnt realize is that no one takes his films seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he has is no only redundant but doesnt comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish as far as seagal and his acting hes rather boring he squints he kills period nothing else oh yeah theres corny oneliners im gonna reach out and touch someone of course hes the star and were supposed to root for him and all so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks michael caine whos a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he does it well i guess but this is no alfie of coure no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring as well but is not horrible and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailers and for seagals ego and also look for billy bob thornton as one of ermeys assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagals movies is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one has that message which makes it more excrucitating to watch i mean if you do rent it and i dont reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock 
arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar go to the movies fall in love move in together etc review well if you havent seen when harry met sally or he said she said or if you dont watch love war on television you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages however if youve seen any of these than you have seen most of this film this of course doesnt mean its bad some of it is amusing but overall i just had to ask whats the point arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love kevin pollack is the stereotypical femalefearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes most if which werent very funny couteney cox is the stereotypical careerminded woman who falls in love julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical this film uses a lot of formula the plot is basically known from the opening credits so what is good about the movie well as i said there are a few amusing moments surprisingly julie brown who i usually find just plain goofy was the best thing in the film also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual gee this is really short not much to say about the film really it is just kind of there watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time but i wouldnt recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre 
soldier is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesnt have jean claude van damme in it i could liken it to the scifi cheese that was the hollywood productofchoice back in the early 80s but that would be too much of a compliment if there is a movie theater in hell this film is playing there 24 hours a day the story such that there is revolves around todd kurt russell an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a nottoodistant ultraconservative future is there any other kind after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesnt matter because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash yes folks theres more we see todd as a buff scarred adult now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat theres a new wrinkle though todd and his brethren are declared obsolete and a new batch of soldiers takes their place after losing a sanctioned battle with dragons jason scott lee the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying icecube tray well thats what is looked like on a remote garbage planet if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them youre way ahead of the game the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you halfexpect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute its surprising that soldier is the brainchild of blade runner cowriter david webb peoples unlike that mindtwisting classic this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three doublespaced pages add into the mix the mortal kombats paul anderson inept direction and its easy to see how soldier turned out so bad and the special effects remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars gary busey is in this movie nuff said soldier is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all now if youll excuse me i have to go weep for the future 
its a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film the last samurai though the blurb alludes to a jungle filled with political intrigue uneasy alliances and murderous enemies at every turn the story of the movie is actually quite simple and prosaic a middleaged japanese businessman named endo played by john fujioka and his assistant both of whom have samurai aspirations travel to africa in search of his ancestor who went to bring buddhism to africa he hires the services of downattheheels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo the redoubtable lance henriksen and his girlfriend arabella holzbog and travels to the camp of an armsmerchantcumsafarihost cumislamicmissionary john saxon and his wife lisa eilbacher they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witchdoctor aspirations to conceal a prearranged arms deal which subsequently falls through congo escapes finds endos ancestors sword and comes back guns blazing to free the rest of them and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword the end the last samurai is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable it is merely there the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated subplots that are never explained and many scenes that make very little sense at all the film is shot through with all the tired old inscrutable japanese samurai and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie it is quite slowpaced with only a bit of action near the end and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic most of the acting is fair with the possible exception of congos girlfriend lance henriksen is his usual scenechewing self and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery i paid 3 for this film from the discount rack at best buy and halfway suspect i overpaid for it if you are in the mood for samurai read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie skip the last samurai unless you are a diehard henriksen fan 
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives are we doing what we want to be doing what happened to our dreams with the new millennium our collective big birthday just around the corner some people are sensing a certain dissatisfaction with their existence the old standbys of traditional religion and science arent doing it for many anymore and theyre looking for something else well be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years ricky hayman jeff goldblum is having a career crisis the programming director for the good buy home shopping network hes going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically new producer kate newell kelly preston is supposed to whip things into shape when the two are fixing a flat they almost run down new age pilgrim g murphy g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they dont really want all that commercial crap in some unexplained manner this causes sales to sour ricky is saved the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all its not an overthetop comedy or a heartwarming message of humanity it is a mishmosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog i am willing to put up with preaching from a film but the messages here are old hat you should take time to smell the roses selling your soul for cash is a bad idea golly im glad i saw the movie i never would have thought of these the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed when g takes a chainsaw to the set theres an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious it doesnt happen the bits are so subdued and overlylong that theres only a hint of laughter from the audience murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better there are hints of promise in this one the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shavedheaded character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen the others are horrendous goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his invasion of the body snatchers his relationship with kate makes no sense they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value an attempt to satirize stupid television we get a selfparody instead 
m i2 the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it tries to be a spyromance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human the coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for threequarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed as for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen m i2 opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way its a megabuck film adapted from a popular hightech gadgetry tv series but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance john woo broken arrow faceoff is good at doing car chases choreographed fights with midair flips and kungfu kicks slomo shots of two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just cant seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and coproducer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an actionfilm girl and seems like a fish outofwater in this one their romance didnt work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasnt convincing the film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success we will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain which explains the films mythic theme as we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott does so in a onedimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cialike clone he steals the package with the antidote peels off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted a plot as that film had it was still a superior film to this sequel woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground as it is used so often in this film by both sides so much so that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglasses hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a highgadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told as an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charges will be dropped hopkins then signs off with the tag line this message will selfdestruct in five seconds actually with the departure of hopkins it was this disposable film that actually selfdestructed at this point in seville hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her exboyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f ck her the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him as she leads them to his hideout in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way the terrorists who aim to rule the world are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billions on the stock ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan does this rescue against all odds as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorists and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder seans getting it as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kickboxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kicks everyones ass if i was only entertained by this i could have lived with it but this film was so badly made that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slamdunks but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is a criticproof film and will in all probability do well in the box office as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into 
exuniversal soldier luc has to battle a group of newermodel engineered fighters gone bad the review jeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier the return his latest attempt to remain relevant that sums up this entire movie he says been there done that no film critic could possibly sum up van dammes recent film choices any better while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him martial arts and guns this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex he joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away universal soldier the return is truly poor the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade specifically terminator 2 judgement day and the similarly named soldier soldiers kurt russell was an older model supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors for the good of a planet schwarzeneggers terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine the t1000 and jeanclaude a former universal soldier has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of you guessed it newer model soldiers considering the poor box office performance of soldier its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead luc devereaux van damme was the sole remaining universal soldier or unisol for short until he was returned to a normal if muscular human form in this sequel technically the fourth film in the series following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise luc is now a human trainerconsultant of sorts for the unisol program working with dylan cotner xander berkeley who interestingly also appeared in t2 the unisol program has engineered a tougher fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth unfortunately upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government seth takes control of his soldiers killing everyone in the building except for luc his partner maggie his daughter hillary and erin a reporter trapped inside the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers most notably romeo popular wrestler goldberg there are lots of fights gun battles lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility there are so many clich s in this film that it is almost painful to watch luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on and in the course of a single night they go from bickering to falling for each other to kissing erin is a patheticallywritten character people are getting brutally gunned down all around her and yet not only does this not seem to frighten her but she finds time to remind luc that she isnt leaving without her story whatever other laughable moments include a luc going to a strip club to get internet access what and b a group of rangers who after having been given good advice luc tells them that their weapons are useless and shows them a specific gun which should work better choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway guess who wins the battle not one single scene in universal soldier the return has any originality to it when fuelled by don davis loud driving music score the films many fights become almost passable but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves director mic rodgers a former stunt coordinator keeps the action coming at a rapid pace with only a few token serious moments to be found his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion if only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li rodgers could probably have made a decent action film to place the blame squarely at van dammes feet however is an injustice im not sure that anyone not even robert deniro or edward norton could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access he cringes looks down and mutters uh uhm they all do i saw it on 60 minutes eh he he he the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg he chews up every scene he is in obviously enjoying his role immensely he even gives the film a few laughs as he mutters things like i really dont like that guy every time he fails to kill luc sadly his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo 
the plot of big mommas house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress thats not just the highconcept premise its the fullyrealized allencompassing plot such an emphasis is not unheardof in the world of hollywood summer entertainment one need merely look back to last summer when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent the trap inherent in such an approach is that the highconcept plot idea better be pretty wellrealized or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time not a developed character not a provocative theme not a witty twist you will get 90plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress nothing more nothing less those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the onenote dud that is big mommas house others will simply stare mouth agape at its sheer unapologetic laziness lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john paul giamatti dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco terrence howard has escaped from prison and the feds think hes headed for his former girlfriend and presumedbutneverproved accomplice sherry nia long sherry however has fled with her son trent jascha washington possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ella mitchell better known as big momma indeed sherry appears to be on her way but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows big mommas houses bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs doubtfire director raja gosnell edited that film and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom but theres just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main characters attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman unfortunately big mommas house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters suspension of disbelief in big mommas house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind andor stupid since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other of course laughs trumps logic every time and big mommas house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foultempered beast while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry unfortunately no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another very different real person so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags malcolm reacting violently to big mommas explosive diarrhea attack malcolmasmomma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife one of the few sequences that works martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times but theres no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character hes just big momma without the makeup on i wont waste time commenting on how ineptly the setup of the escaped convict is employed since it was clearly a waste of time to the filmmakers there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure but hes ultimately a distraction in a film thats really about its central visual incongruity and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia longs posterior im never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing but i know that when a filmmaker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that its an entire film i duck out of the way the gross implausibility of big mommas house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big cleverlyconstructed laughs its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant big mommas house is ridiculous and not funny its just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress 
starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role not that cindy does that bad its just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindys extraordinary acting skills but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but im sure that that is just a coincidence no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet well thats just a happy coincidence sure william baldwin isnt a bad actor unfortunately he just doesnt demonstrate it at all in this movie im not sure if thats because most of his lines were just so hokey or if he was trying to make cindys acting look good if it was the latter it worked cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie which is not to say that she doesnt have room for improvement although to be fair to cindy her lines were kinda cheesy in places so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema well im glad you asked that question cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents why woud they target someone as likable as cindy you ask by the end of the movie you wont care the story is so contrived it isnt funny anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house without getting so much as a scratch i might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin whos character max kilpatric a police detective seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagals early films the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwins characters of the run from these killer russians isnt all that bad of an idea its just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes if i was baldwin id hope this film disappears as for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability unfortunately any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks its too bad they hadnt spent more time on a half decent plot since ms crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you 
take a look at the following equation a christmas carolghostbustersscrooged yes scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether scrooged is alternatively sick gross funny and then sickly soppy bill murray plays frank cross a t v executive with a horrible personality hes evil to secretary actors crew everyone except the t vs stations boss of course played by the late robert mitchum however he is then visited by a very dead exec who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts past present and future who is called the ghost of yet to come for some reason sure enough they arrive show cross how much of a s o b he is and he changes his way however throughout this simple plot weve got to suffer outlandish special effects poor comedy and an very very mean performance from bill murray frank cross isnt funny mean hes just mean he also isnt very good at emotional scenes and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is and how he has changed however the supporting cast are ok with good performances from mitchum allen who plays his girlfriend and john glover who plays crosss partner the ghost of christmas past isnt that bad either sadly though the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present played by carol kane whoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny should be fired straight away and the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 if i remeber correctly who thankfully dosent say much the script is horrendous michael odonaghue churns out terrible bad taste jokes which i guess is the whole point really then changes direction completely to emotional scenes and he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes which are awful the special effects look nice but do nothing for the film theres some impressive make up effects also the music is also good which is scored by danny elfman but great effects and make up dont make a great film scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech why didnt cross just look out his exec window and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him overall then youd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided perhaps a plague 
synopsis a maniac crazed by virulent microphage slaughters more than twenty people including a street gang and heavilyarmed troops with a small knife even with a handgun however he cant take out the two cops who are after him despite having shot one of them a total of seven times comments the most notable aspect of adrenalin fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge not only does she manage to keep all her clothes on her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses this will probably disappoint many henstridge fans but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles though i admit it doesnt show in this mess henstridge just like every other actor in the film delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey the cast also includes christopher lambert who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films how on earth this movie got two bigname stars to appear in it is beyond me adrenalin fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future 2007 boston has changed dramatically in those ten years it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with policia printed on their doors some guy has a really bad virus and hes killing people because of it so the brave good guys lambert and henstridge go after him thats it 76 minutes never seemed so long this is a drawnout chase scene through dimlylit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie the plot development is nil we learn absolutely nothing about lamberts character and very little about henstridges character the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridortunnelairduct next and who will carry the flashlight a subplot does exist involving henstridges characters illegal attempt to get her son out of boston in her opening monologue a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son twenty minutes into the film i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot in a defining scene of the movie however i changed my mind this fake passport drops to the ground lamberts cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away must not have been a good fake this emphasizes another fault with the film things just defy common sense lamberts cop for instance is shot seven times yet he is still able to talk and slide about adrenalin fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesnt seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for i found myself rather bored with this film which will disappoint both scifihorror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert dont fear the rush fear the movie watch something else 
postchasing amy a slew of lovetriangle movies this month we have kissing a fool costarring amys own lee and april brings us the object of my affection which may as well be titled chasing allan for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it that film stars schwimmers friend jennifer aniston if only kevin smith could write them all schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max who falls in love with his best friend jay lee s book editor samantha avital a mere twentyfour hours after meeting her they are soon engaged and max because of his own raging libido grows suspicious of samanthas fidelity he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book to test her the trouble is jay might be secretly in love with her to stretch this flat sitcom premise to feature length the plot is framed by a climactic wedding at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular talethe events leading up to the nuptialsto an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue and lee poor lee is miscast so hysterically funny in chasing amy here he is forced to repress his comic instincts to swear to yell to talk about oral sex the scripts idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a sensitive man and then show him drinking pepto bismol when hes stewing over his girl trouble as for avital an israeli actress she is warm and sweet but we dont know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer who plays schwimmers assistant and personal temptress turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo there are a handful a smattering of good scenes in kissing a fool i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club during which jay gets up and asks has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her over and over until hes booted off stage there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything thats on the page kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night jokemachine friends that spawned schwimmers movie career so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back 
yet another brainless teen flick this one is about surprise drugs and sex stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldnt look more bored their characters are cardboard cutouts of every cliched teenager out there one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie everything about it annoyed the hell out of me the acting and script the plot and ending the director of the fluke hit swingers could have very well directed a bunch of noname actors and had a watchabe film the big stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality i felt like i was watching dawsons creek episode 200 although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast the surprise ending was sooo predictable since when is a male characters sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore go is dawsons creek varsity blues shes all that go home and watch something else

at first glance i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise its plotline goes like this the evil king cromwell desiring to take over the world resurrects an evil ancient sorceror xusia for power he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents given a triplebladed sword which can shoot bad guys like a gun by his dying father talon vows for revenge eleven years later when hes established his own army the mercaneries he vows to take back his kingdom along the way he meets up with alana whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell talon vows to help and after a series of minor escapades eventually ends up rescuing alanas brother and several other prisoners only to be captured himself in other words put on a cross to be crucified fortunately he frees himself rescues alana from marrying cromwell defeats xusia and then cromwell all with his triple bladed sword during the final battle the blade breaks but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade then everything ends happily unfortunately the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping bad acting and gruesomely gory bloody scenes never once does the story seem to connect together it just jumps around repeatedly this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia after telling him that he needs his help he leads the warlock out into daylight but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards wait a minute didnt the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade ehdan which he cannot do by military force if that is the case why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him and why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway these questions are just never no never answered in the film another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alanas wedding to cromwell and finally at the end instead of settling down with alana he just tells her to wait and then he just rides off in addition to the extremely bloody scenes this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure even some attempts to make it exciting a few fire scenes battle scenes dont work it just completely fails altogether miserably the only good thing about this film is its musical score contributed by david whittaker who had an extremely short music composing career the score is boomy and adventurous powerful and a billion times better than this film is my suggestion steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead if you can find it ironically though before the films credits roll there is a message indicating that a sequel tales of the ancient empire would follow to my relief and delight it never got into production because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office grossing only 39 million critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer all right leonard maltin rightfully called it second rate in scripting and acting and ataglance film reviews called it a confusing stupid unimaginative unengaging bloodfilled bore i totally agree with these reviews all right and i hope that this piece of will be forgotten about there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer i hope you get a good laugh out of this review but i am not laughing in fact my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time 
this movie stinks although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss i knew i was in for trouble when during the opening establishment shots we see a detailed closeup of warrant officer paul brenners john travolta military identification card and it is the wrong color this might seem like a minor detail but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training or what about when brenner tells a suspect that because he is in the military he doesnt have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through for example at the beginning of the film paul brenner an undercover army investigator gets into a gun and knife battle at his offpost houseboat and windsup killing an arms dealer he had been investigating the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing but instead of arresting him or at least take him into custody for further questioning they release him duh ultimately brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding generals daughter a young captain also assigned to the post when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the generals daughter does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects no his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing eventually brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier i wont even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the armys suppression of this horrendous crime i will just mention one final flaw brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia the rape occurred in west point which is in new york he is under a very tight and totally implausible 36hour deadline to solve this case he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point does he phone the doctor no he travels via some unexplained very fast transport to new york to question the psychiatrist in person and then he returns to georgia again by the miracle transport without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline you have been warned stay away from this one 
 it was not scary these are the first words that came to mind after it was over when a movie is called vampires not scary arent words that should be associated with it but that wasnt my only gripe john carpenter is a name associated with cuttingedge cinema as in the intense scares of halloween the thing and the prince of darkness or the offbeat action of they live and escape from new york unfortunately the only thing that is cutting edge about vampires is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach with an anemic plot and notquitekosher special effects john carpenters vampires has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers led by james woods of all people like some sort of holy ateam they even have their own soupedup van the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack their method is amusingly innovative the bloodsuckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks to commemorate their victory the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away their celebration is shortlived however as a master vampire named valek ambushes and singlehandedly destroys most of the team woods jack crow and buddy montoya daniel baldwin escape with their lives along with a woman named katrina sheryl lee although the woman has been bitten montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek thomas ian griffith a freaky marilyn mansontype whos on a mission that dates back 600 years along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau tim guinee a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl upham in saving private ryan some stuff happens in the middle of the movie but i cant remember most of it because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen vampires finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix as crow guiteau and montoya assault an abandoned prisonturned vampire nest only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick but its too little too late we get the inevitable final confrontation but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic come on were dealing with the master vampire here interestingly last summers vampire actioner blade was derived from a comic book and vampires from a novel yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former a more deliberate superhero flick woods jack crow spouts glib offthecuff oneliners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that ohsocool stride and his motive for killing vampires take a wild guess hint a killed his when he was just a at least blade had decent action and slick stylishness vampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamerthin plot to make up for this the movie resorts to other shocks such as its generally condescending attitude towards women crow slaps them around for the fun of it and an overplayed contempt for religion crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to getting woodies it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie if not scary and gory i wanted tense relentless and exhausting john carpenters vampires is none of these i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan for the rest of you looking for a good scare beware vampires is a film with no teeth 
perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at times could elicit some laughter by blurting out semioffensive phrases in his raspy voice coated with a condescending attitude his shtick was marked by crassness in this movie for example when his girlfriend says that shes kicking him out because hes been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months he tries to calm the situation by saying maybe youll feel better after we have some dirty sex this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly cant go the distance in a fulllength feature dirty work is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically emotionally theyve never outgrown their pubescent years which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback although having no apparent real world skills the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with 50 000 in a period of two weeks so that sams dad jack warden can have a heart operation their idea is to start a revengeforhire business where theyll do your dirty work in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot their presence is established but when a lessthanhonorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge by default dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots but it delivers jerky boys level material except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call already weak on material it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction but whats really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he says after getting beat up note to self theres always beer he says after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like were just watching an elongated rehash of his notsoglorious days on saturday night live much like the television show for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits the rest of the story is just dead space 
summer movies are by nature dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money wild wild west the latest will smith affair follows much the same formula except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies will smith plays jim west a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses he is called by president grant kline to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon kline again and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind named dr loveless branagh with a zany moustache before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair ill give it a chance with the positives theres a nice credit sequence the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye and the special effects are decent enough theres also a pleasant soundtrack buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes and salma hayek pops up as the female interest which is always nice to see apart from these factors though nothing else in wild wild west works firstly theres little chemistry between smith and kline who appears to be in it purely for the money one would expect zingers passing between the two none arise both of them plod through the below standard plot knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment although he is over the top the material doesnt present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy therefore he just comes across as loud as obnoxious the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek who is given so little screen time its embarrassing she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body and be ogled at by kline and smith her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script and there is no sense of realism about the character the humour in the film is also very off will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black here not even smith could save the humour on display the script largely boils down to insults that arent very funny and oneliners that barely raise a smirk its also somewhat racist although it doesnt intend to be with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching and actually says slavery is good to save himself its not a funny scene and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man in this case kline in a dress is automatically unfunny it isnt but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness theres also problems with the plot jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying and rely purely on luck rather than audience pleasing skill plot elements are introduced into the film and then thrown away just as quickly the main piece of the story a 80 foot mechanical steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive but theres no particular reason why it should be built why not loveless build a great big tank instead of an ungainly fragile piece of machinery thats just begging to be blown up director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them with some nice camera tricks but even this is missing from this stilted affair wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing but not much of it is evident making this film drag out even more its a sad thing when four credited screenwriters a talented director and a willing star cant make a film work and eventually wild wild west collapses under its sexist mildly racist unfunny weight 
what were they thinking nostalgia for the seventies is bad enough but do we really need an eighties film robbie hart adam sandler used to want to be a rock and roll star but in 1985 hes singing at weddings and having a good time a romantic at heart he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his highschool sweetie when she leaves him waiting at the altar his tune changes to love stinks he meets waitress julia drew barrymore who is engaged to a junkbonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together in fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie sandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role but there is no spark barrymore doesnt seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it beauty but no attitude both characters are just there bit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show the eighties are shoved in our face references to deloreans madonna dallas ivana and donald burt and loni and miami vice get old fast the filmmakers must have realized that there wasnt much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions theyre not funny and it doesnt work with change on all fronts accelerating more and more nostalgia appears to have a great appeal but dont you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past maybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be 
and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners not rating anything lower than your standard this movie sucks along comes this cinematic atrocity and hes forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick even the bravest moviegoer would think twice about seeing this waste of time yes despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie the latest highlander doesnt seem to have anything going for it oh stinky movie let me count thee ways plot from what i understood a really bad highlander dude comes to the present looking to whack out the nice highlander dudes in order to gain their power and become the mightiest immortal or something along those lines critique a complete and utter mess disjointed incoherent boring corny filled with bad dialogue and thats just the first thirty minutes this film doesnt seem to know what to do with itself its confusing to anyone who doesnt know the series i include myself in that group and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series i include diehard highlander fan the arrow in that group the film doesnt explain anything about itself it just goes from one inexplicable situation to another one moment theyre in the present time the next moment theyre in italy in the 1600s why who knows what are they talking about no idea flashbacks mixed in with the present mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene hullo confused yet i was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story random swordplay mad maxlike dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s or were they in the present at that time who knows and to be honest who seriously cares this series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago but sadly someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it please please for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of moviemaking and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film put this series to bed and end it even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one the director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material but all he could come up with is plenty of slomo action some fastmotion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere and is there anything spectacular about the swordplay or fight scenes nope and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face closeups yipes the man is not aging gracefully is he oh boy and i havent even gotten around to the greatest piece of overacting that ive seen in years the man who plays kell in this movie bruce payne should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near overacting is not a hobby for this guy its a living hes also very funny not purposely though all in all the movie stinks nuff said 
bats is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan to pull something like this off you need to have a sense of wit and style with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines something like the underground worm thriller tremors had just the perfect mixture of these elements and in return the film was tremendous fun with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player bats mainly plays its premise for straightarrow horror judging by the ridiculous premise this was not exactly a wise move the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcocks the birds but fails miserably done right it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema unfortunately bats is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly terribly wrong the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom bats is aimed toward those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats these bats are not very nice because they eat a lot of people boy are these bats ugly they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them superduper smart theyve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all a whole bunch of people in texas get killed so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with but the bats are pretty smart so its sorta hard to do the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good but no bats is probably too violent for preschoolers the film directed by louis morneau should have ventured straight into video stores on the small screen perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure the film is poorly written poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude even the bats themselves are cheesy and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey lou diamond phillips who embodies every pathetic stereotype a smalltown authority figure usually portrays he chomps on a cigar struts contentedly in his boots etc the scientist is dr sheila casper dina meyer who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as the best in her field meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable but everything about dr casper is recycled beyond recognition her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in jaws everything revolving around bats is tired drivel which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw with voices dubbed in later in fact that may have worked out better in the end take one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy leon and youll have immediate deja vu hes the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie constructed specifically for timed comic relief unfortunately none of his comic interludes are funny in the role of deranged mad scientist dr mccabe the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch mccabe accidentally released two experimental test subjects and the virus spread to other bats the entire town of gallup texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else something like when is the damn movie going to be over i just want my money the bats are ugly i must say theres the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing but mainly the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been but by the absurdly stupid climax its way too late in the game for a decent recovery characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire lets explore the logic there is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one and after that there are only 18 000 more of them this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind bats 
the most interesting part of cant hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of us the one part that many of us can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the films sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored the film wisely holds over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost too nicely for some members of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of whats going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why weve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with everyones here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominions of trekkies and xphiles the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial lame and basically as a bunch of losers except for denise who rolls her eyes at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quotes oscar wilde definite pointers there unfortunately the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film as i said portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these characters into our heroes we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared andor identified with them and if we did we certainly dont want to revisit that state of being heres a quick lowdown its graduation and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night otherwise known as the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party cant hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the imwhiningbecauseicantgetagirliwant brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer whos been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart now that shes broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note hes written declaring his love for her in the hopes hell build up the guts to give it to her even though hes leaving for a multiweek intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it wouldnt be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because its a party there are some more main characters such as william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominions who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike whos humiliated him for years but gets too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom dont ask with kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes films of the 80s most notably sixteen candles the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize its characters and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes and then says that its all okay we cant take this film seriously nor can we take this as fun so really what good is it but i will tell you some things i did like i liked the direction except for a couple toooverthetop features like waytooglossy jump cuts its like an oxymoron and other obscurities generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altmanesque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio days his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesnt work with the film when really thought about shes far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone shes not just the cynic or the intellectual shes just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters she may ruin the film more but at least when shes on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least well be entertained a couple other things that just dont work mikes character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesnt work at all jenna eflmans uncredited cameo as an angel just didnt work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason im giving this such a low rating is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything wed do we dont feel for these characters because for most of us we arent stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots the acid test for high school movies is does it at all capture the feel of what its portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though 
the film may be called mercury rising but that title doesnt describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture a routine thriller that combines government coverups with a cloying and poorlymotivated buddy story the hook that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic however aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device those expecting to see even a semithorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism the script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard toswallow i dont know whether the problem is in the original book simple simon or in the screenplay adaptation but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible once again certain standby plot elements the highlevel government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent are recycled and not to good effect while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold art jeffries bruce willis is confronted with his own failure unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death the event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavyhandedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9year old simon lynch miko hughes when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player soon art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time with the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player always just a step behind them along the way they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy chi mcbride and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest kim dickens why is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an exfootball player apparently the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultrasecret code called mercury to make sure it cant be cracked they do the most intuitive thing possible place a sample of it in a nerds puzzle magazine of course no one can solve it no one except autistic simon that is when he calls the phone number listed in the solution he gets the nsa as a result the coldhearted sneering government man alec baldwin decides that simon has to be eliminated for the good of the country of course but he hasnt counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold even though everyone in the audience has its hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesnt do anything exceptionally well and does quite a few things rather poorly for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from timetotime but even the most exciting scenes such as the one where art and simon are crouched down avoiding passing trains arent that pulsepounding the climactic struggle is a real hohum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness overall director harold becker is constantly struggling and failing to generate even a moment that isnt derivative or obligatory bruce willis star seems to be fading this is his fourth straight lackluster outing following last man standing the fifth element and the jackal willis isnt terrible but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through and often does alec baldwin combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice does some scenery chewing but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace the films real star is young miko hughes heather langenkamps son in wes cravens new nightmare who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual but is about 50 years younger mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain the replacement killers and u s marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers for those who like action and adventure in the theater this has not been a good year hopefully the advent of summer will change that until then the best choices for bruce willis or any other action hero are on video and if youre determined to see mercury rising check out the morning sky in early may 
 alcohol and drugs bad not alcohol and drugs good got it just when you though youve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen be that insanity or alcoholism hollywood releases yet another one of those deep emotional stories about finding yourself 28 days is practically a visualization of the usual meaningful true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aameetings gwennie sandra bullock is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol for her life was a big party with no beginning and no end this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper dominic west borrowed her sisters elizabeth perkins wedding limo and crashed it into someones house this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in courtordered rehab here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption willpower and commitment most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party the film itself feels like a rehab program whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times it is a classic cautionary tale an echo a big fat and expensive clich a shadow of last years girl interrupted which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like the cuckoos nest and trainspotting director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a dramacomedy jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues alienation despair terror confusion loneliness and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean isnt that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park betty thomas idea of hell is a cozy homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke drink or watch tv after 11 it is simply too light simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story all you need to do is just say no says dr cornell steve buscemi as if was the revelation of the century and thats how simple it is in fact i would rather watch lost in space once again than return to 28 days as for acting its acceptable but hardly anything else for sandra bullock its an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than speed she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop dominic west shines as the source of gwenies devilish temptations but elizabeth perkins and steve buscemis great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters although intellectually girl interrupted was a greater achievement 28 days is superior in its visual aspect there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor the most important thing is that weve seen it before and it was a lot better clean and sober only when i laugh when a man loves a woman leaving las vegas and many other stronger films were made about the same issues so whats the point in other words 28 days doesnt contribute to the moviemaking business on any level if youre caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and youre standing in front of the movie theatre you might as well go in and watch 28 days under all other circumstances stay away because this film equals 8 and 103 minutes lost 
capsule combine one quart of raiders of the lost ark a dash of a jackie chan movie sans jackie two teaspoons of gun and swordplay and a dollop of cgi simmer for 100 minutes yields zilch the phantom is a depressing and tired retread of so many earlier better movies that after the fifteenminute mark i started cataloguing them out loud its hard to make a good actionadventure movie that doesnt simply recycle its predecessors and ive seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully the phantom allegedly based on the longrunning comic of the same name doesnt even bother to be graceful its a stupid and incompetent movie in too many ways to list but ill try the film opens up with a prelude sequence that looks like it was slashed to ribbons in the editing and then given a heavy voiceover to compensate for whatever got thrown out we go from there to a jungle sequence that i swear to god recycles the truckchase scene from raiders of the lost ark notefornote possibly even shotforshot right down to the moment where indy wrenched open the door and slung one of the drivers out into the brush and then goes on to rip off the ropebridge scene from sorcerer as well sorcerer as you may well remember was a remake of a french movie the wages of fear in which a bunch of lowlifes were paid piles of money to drive a truck loaded with nitro through horrible jungle terrain both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick but ive got my job to do so back to the salt mines we go anyway the cinematic theft doesnt stop there or at least the lack of inspiration there isnt a single thing here we havent seen and its not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest we have wheres my list a bad girl a tough good girl a secret cave hideaway which seems inspired more by dr no than anything else a boardroom meeting that drips with greed and venality magical artifacts of terrible power and caryhiroyuki tagawa wasted in another stupid role where he gets to wear a fu manchu mustache and sneer a lot and generally humiliate himself what else is there the plot is a waste of time the sets alternate between big but hokey and tiny and still hokey there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked and im sure once mike and the bots get the cash theyll stick it on their sked the only thing in the movie worth noting is billy zane hes a good actor and he tries very hard even when the script is sending him down one dead alley of a scene after another all i can say is that i pray this isnt the beginning of the end for him although it sure looks like the final nail in the coffin for the comicbook superhero movie 
a new entry in the revisionist history genre of filmmaking dick suggests that two nottoobright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nations biggest presidential scandal kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlenes watergate hotel room accidentally stumble across g gordon liddy played deadon by harry shearer and the infamous breakin when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip they are ushered into a conference room questioned as to what they know and leave as official presidential dog walkers the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with when they discover that nixon another deadon performance by dan hedaya who actually favors nixon slightly unlike anthony hopkins has been abusive to checkers the presidential dog thanks to the conversations that he always recorded they quit and become disillusioned during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein events are set into motion that eventually lead to the presidents resignation this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry kingtype talk show featuring a cameo by french stewart about revealing the identity of deep throat from there we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad dick joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy at one point the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial the band manages to stop right as dunst screams you have to stop letting dick run your life much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault its juvenile bathroom humor but its not the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audiences throat in the least subtle way possible i dont recall oliver stones nixon having to pander to its audience but of course that film wasnt a comedy aimed squarely at a 1320 yearold film going audience the only redeeming thing about this movie is its remarkable supporting cast i wanted to see more of ferrell and mccullochs woodward and bernstein those two characters are the sole basis for my rating i wish they had been given more screen time but unfortunately they are only relegated to the final halfhour their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight especially mccullochs constant thwarting of ferrells attempts to gather information from the girls who in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsys brother the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters but are given nothing to work with id like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities as for the two leads dunst and williams can definitely do better they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele the early years in this particular film a highly dubious distinction at best stay through the first half of the end credits though to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie an excellent idea marred by poor execution dick could have been a great movie less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds as it stands though dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as dick and poopie jokes and that to me does not make a funny movie pg13 
words i thought id never write the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace wit and power of the original put the gun to my head pull the trigger and put me out of my misery better yet put the horror genre out of its misery when youve finished watching urban legends final cut youll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting terrible script and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today urban legends final cut is a smorgasbord of stolen movie ideas mainly from the blair witch project and scream fabulous people with perfect teeth and skin one creepy film school and a dog eating a freshly removed kidney from one of the movies hapless victims urban legends delivers a story about a bunch of film students working on their thesis films to win the coveted hitchcock award which guarantees the winner a director deal in hollywood one female filmmaker jennifer morrison the freaky dead girl from stir of echoes writes a fiction script based on a serial killer who kills his victims according to urban legend tales suddenly her entire crew starts getting bumped off with urbanlegendary homicides but the bodies are always missing and she is often the only witness to the killings the killer wears a fencing mask and a long black overcoat looking like a scorned olympian out to avenge his defeat in sydney why this is scary is never explained of course the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuitys sake urban legends has one minor recurring character from the original who we never cared about anyway the security guard of all people the other central problem is that this character has already seen the urban legend killings once before but shes utterly clueless about whats going on around her call it suspension of disbelief this film is also a prime example of how horror films are now completely dead in the water the last decent horror film was the blair witch project and that seemed more like a snuff film than fiction the stalking killer with crazy motivation has become a tired clich as everyone seems to have forgotten real horror is not about what is seen but about what is unknown 
godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who cares about plot summer movie a loose remake of the 1954 classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monsters which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlins bigbudget lizardstompsmanhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind the script isnt just dumbed down its lobotomized godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone presumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boys the demographic most likely to shell out 7 repeatedly to see the same images of monsterinstigated carnage thats not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction theyre just not as readily susceptible this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computergenerated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors stargate was a financial success independence day was a runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tieins before it even opens its virtually guaranteed at least 100 million nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a nottooprecocious grade school kid godzilla isnt completely without merit although it is close theres a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wears off quickly frankly while the special effects are competent theyre not all that stunning theres nothing new here its jurassic park meets aliens with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computergenerated visuals to the next level godzilla never really pushes the envelope preferring to remain within a comfort zone the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival worst of all godzilla isnt even exciting with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isnt a sequence in this film that raises the pulse even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawnprovoking independence day may have been dumb but it was full of adrenaline moments capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of its production as in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that were never sure who were supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paperthin humans trying to stop him the plot such as it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands godzilla shows up in the big apple he does some of the usual tourist things stops by madison square garden visits the chrysler building goes on a walk through central park and takes the subway in the process he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs but he never has trouble with traffic jams on hand to stop him is an elite u s army unit led by a slightly lessarrogantthanusual military man kevin dunn and a biologist named nick tatopoulos who has a theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific in nicks words godzilla is a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of its kind as luck would have it nicks old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is a reporter based at a new york tv station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla then just when the military has rejected nicks theory about why godzilla is in new york a member of the french secret service jean reno recruits him for a special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla has chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies independence day deep impact armageddon that its becoming boring the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall he could climb the empire state building at ten times that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor theres an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sitcom material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nicks last name properly and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager eberts reelection slogan is not surprisingly thumbs up for new york the siskelebert stuff is amusing the first time its used but after a while it grows tiresome and although the characters dont serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich doesnt want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard thats not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno arent capable of good performances both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they arent alist names then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine maria pitillo dear god plays the love interest and hank azaria great expectations is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief ultimately it doesnt really matter what i or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie tristar has assumed that godzilla like all selfproclaimed summer event motion pictures is pretty much criticproof it may also be wordofmouthproof those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say so when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time its like spitting into the wind emmerich and devlin are master illusionists waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors its probably too much to hope that some day moviegoers will wake up and realize that theyve been had 
recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann couldnt sleep he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food then he took down a volume of shakespeares work and read it cover to cover never really paying attention to the words or plot and then as a climax he took out his video camera and pressed the on button the result william shakespeares romeo juliet the worst film ever made and a complete failure though to be fair an interesting complete failure the idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we cant see what is going on and filming the dialogue in voice over and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model and making the frame go still while flashing the characters name at the bottom and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion i mean man this is the 90s dude however ive seen terrible films that are fun to watch examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau that rule doesnt apply here this is a film that takes itself seriously that is its major fault another problem was pointed out by my friend alex who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didnt take sides here its clear that we are supposed to side with romeo just look at the way they film him from the begining hes our hero and this doesnt work and dicaprios awful performance doesnt help luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us the result is a mess you can feel him striving to be something he isnt he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles he tries very hard key word tries oh look hes filming above water action from below pretty what does it represent why do people do ugly things i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face 
in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person what may be a disastrous situation for one may be seen as a challenge to another as deepak chopra is known to say its not the ride its the rider unfortunately clearthinking is not always the reaction to problems wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor michael douglas is a man with troubles hes sunk his money in illegal financial activities and its blown up in his face in a matter of days he will lose it all his wife emily gwyneth paltrow is a highlyplaced un interpreter and is not happy with her life either her marriage is cold and unfulfilling unknown to her her new lover david shaw viggo mortensen is not only a painter but an excon with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money emily is a prime target shes worth over 100 million stevens solution to his predicament is to offer david half a million to kill his wife the artist accepts and the movie is underway drawing from frederick knotts play and loosely based on hitchcocks dial m for murder this is alltoo typical of summer releases all style and no substance and theres really not much style director andrew davis the accomplished witness and bestforgotten other films has made exactly the wrong choices at almost every turn douglas and paltrow have both shown us that they are skillful actors in previous films mortensen showed promise in the past here all three are walking uninterestingly through their roles with oddly waxen faces the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman hes only onscreen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense surprises are important in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen and nothing ever does nearly every event is telegraphed in advance closeup on this object or that action and its easy to guess whats going to happen as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile its a hopeless quest the story doesnt make much sense stevens wife is loaded even with unfriendly relations youd think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her when he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife would your first choice be her lover no matter how sleazy he is i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity why would steven plan the murder as a breakin in their apartment why not just take her out as she was walking to davids loft in a bad neighborhood while deciding among the numerous summer films you might do well to skip this one youll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel 
 virus is a monster movie without a monster any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise sadly virus does not deliver on any level the movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something we never find out what to a big boat with lots of satellites on it sudddenly a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat cut to seven days later we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures see they spend all their time sailing around looking for deadinthewater ships to rescue and then collect the reward money at least i think thats what they do along with many other things in the film their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isnt really explained so they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it and decide to haul it back to russian waters the only problem is the crew starts disappearing onebyone and turning into borg yes borg complete with the red laser beam in place of an eye apparently this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical so it creates makeshift machines and uses humans for spare parts blah blah blah i could go on forever describing the ludicrous socalled plot but i wont suffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man everything else in this movie has been taken from other better movies for example many of the machines resemble those found in the littleseen japanese movie tetsuothe iron man and the plot is right out of aliens the funny thing is i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie i have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies like last years underappreciated deep rising but virus as i mentioned earlier doesnt even have a monster it just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption virus is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it besides the lame monster its chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into for example there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to negotiate with the alien now i dont know about you but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life finally virus isnt scary the least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary as it is its about as frightening as a box of cookies skip virus if its a cool monster movie you want rent the far superior and the granddaddy of this genre aliens

barb wire pamela anderson lees first foray into films highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets being the only notable member of the cast the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity making her characters catch line dont call me babe sound very ironic indeed from the very opening of the movie we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe throughout the movie there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage if not of andersons then at least of the female extras this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire for a plot barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline it is 2017 the middle of the second american civil war and barb wire a former resistance fighter runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazistyle uniforms in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town past the governmentcontrolled areas and to freedom even the airport looks like the one in casablanca except that the plane in the background is a modern private jet there are hardly any significant moments in this film and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of barb wire if anything one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts who could fight and jump in a skimpy strapless leather top and yet keep her breasts from spilling out only a stuntwoman not pamela anderson lee 
humanities quest for knowledge never ends so a team of scientists and filmmakers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe the party consists of anthropologist steven cale eric stoltz and the camera team consisting of terri flores jennifer lopez danny rich ice cube gary dixon owen wilson denise kahlberg kari wuhrer and warren westridge jonathan hyde early on their journey they meet paul sarone jon voight whose boat is stuck on the shore they agree to give him a ride to the next village he claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without scruples who only wants to catch a giant anaconda and sell it to a zoo we dont have to wait too long for the giant snake she just had a panther hors doevre and now is looking for the main course our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard no wonder giant animals mistake their splashing for a dinner bell our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp enjoy so much for the first attempt to catch her but who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition one by one she goes after the others eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure the rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not the way the makers of the movie had planned however the scenes without the anaconda are rather boring whenever the leading lady shows up were in for a laugh the snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an aweinspiring monster her attacks always follow the same plan one last hypnotic look shes looking at you kid then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down mostly we dont see the act of devouring but she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real the animatronics are somewhat more believable but that didnt work for the strangling scenes dont go see the movie for the fx they are everything but uptodate the viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to hisher surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team we may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work a well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation the majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling anyway what kind of audience is the target group for this movie hard to say this cant be a serious horror movie or can it see for yourself 
absolute power the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff it is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper one can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood not only is the plot unbelievable and contrived but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence continually underestimating the audience the film gives us information we already know or dont even need details essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two nightvision goggles in their car oddly enough the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities a masterful jewelthief played by clint eastwood witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire played by e g marshall while robbing one of marshalls mansions he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault there through a twoway mirror he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman in self defense the woman grabs a letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow she raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men the man he is the president of the united states of america where does the film go wrong it cannot be the acting clint eastwood ed harris and gene hackman as the president give typecast but decent performances the cinematography is sufficient wild and erratic during action sequences dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue even the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thrillersuspense genre the fault clearly lies in the screenplay and the screenplay alone while setting up a story about misuse of power about the true possessors of that power and about intrigue and doublecrossing it does not resolve it not one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax rather the tense situations are left dangling at the end giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant police officers are everywhere incognito of course at the same time not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives all three parties are unaware of each others presence this scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood who might suspect this is a trap will get himself out of this difficult position he will probably have a brilliant plan involving ingenious preparations however when he arrives at the trap both hit men miss how convenient and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away the buildup of this scene took about ten minutes ten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap the scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds parallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter the daughter blames her father for never being there for her because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere of course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family again it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot however trying is simply not enough the second story line should be subtle original and preferably unpredictable everything this film is not how could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced how could eastwood who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven ever believe in a project like this one i am sad to say that my respect for the actordirectorproducer has diminished substantially due to this film director quentin tarantino once said i can make a good movie out of any bad script director clint eastwood obviously cannot

 book should have remained in shadows book of shadows blair witch 2 a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman certain things in our lives are inevitable death sorrow love heartbreak pain joy we expect these events we know theyre going to happen and some we even look forward to its part of the human condition we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society as we near the fall election several of them are hitting us in the face politicians exaggerate their own importance our side is always right theirs is always wrong in the end voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money there will be a sequel even if the original story doesnt merit one even if the first film is complete in itself even if success is a fluke the blair witch project was made with a budget of 1 75 and exploded on the screen raking in huge profits the concept was brilliant the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real the film itself was even more convincing the movie must be authentic why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen the first film caught lightning in a bottle the sequel proves you cant pour that old lightning into a new bottle you have to give this effort some credit it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids it would have been easy but of course it wouldnt have worked instead book of shadows acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release its a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel unfortunately it doesnt work either five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives even weirder stuff happens some people die theres blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense while supposedly doing serious research the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud very obnoxious heavy metal music its a bad plan the cast shows some early promise a couple is doing research on a blair witch book the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick the cute wiccan chick the first films unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods this time these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors theres not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea its ruined by poor execution the followup to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie theyre trapped in an old big weird house they stupidly separate into various rooms there are strange noises they see scary apparitions and people disappear ever see this movie seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore for a storyline filled with surprises its oddly predicable the blair witch project was a rare triumph of style over substance the book of shadows is a triumph of tedium over promise 
warren beatty diane keaton goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsoms version of the classic romantic screwball comedy in town country the drawing room farce of the 30s dealt with sexual innuendo and relied on wit and a great deal of commotion and noise to place the viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action back then impossibly wealthy scions of society with too much free time would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers only to have everything come out all right in the end see the philadelphia story for a great farce town country has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work and sexual misconduct on several levels but there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is tcs downfall there is obviously a great deal of hollywood talent in front of and behind the camera involved in town country but without a likable or at least interesting story to carry through their efforts it is all for naught and thats what we get here naught porter stoddard beatty is a highpowered new york architect with a very good life indeed his 25year marriage to ellie diane keaton appears on the surface to be perfect but there are cracks just below this pristine surface his wife is suspicious of his whereabouts his kids dont need him and his best friends griffin garry shandling and mona goldie hawn are in the midst of a divorce porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late but like a man fighting against quicksand his struggle just sinks him deeper at the 90minute mark of town country i asked myself whats the point i wasnt entertained i laughed three times over silly little pratfalls and spent most of the film marking time til the end warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head keatons ellie is an empty headed flake who cant see the obvious as porter screws around on her and as you get to know them who would want friends like griffin and mona the supporting cast is given nothing to do and sometimes does harm to the film given the material they are forced to use nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling the actress who has eerily failed to age over the years is miscast as the airheaded musician and the character doesnt belong anyway jenna elfman is a sweet but smart ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress is there any other kind in this movie who comes on to porter the saving grace is a pair of quirky perfs by charlton heston and marian seldes as macdowells very strange parents glib rationalization of infidelity like if he doesnt speak english it doesnt count are a staple for the screenplay the morality of the film seems to be if you can get away with it go for it the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldnt want to know never mind befriend the actors do their best but are hamstrung by the weak material helmer chelsom who made the outstanding offbeat comedy funny bones is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on town country the production values are high as one expects from a big budget hollywood film but the opulent sets by caroline hanania lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis and topnotch photography by william fraker cannot save town country the film has had a long list of production and distribution problems and it might have been better for me anyway if hollywood just said no to this movie i give it a d 
the crown jewel of 1970s irwin allen disaster movies the poseidon adventure features an allstar cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship the story begins on the u s s poseidons big new years cruise where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive lets see theres the new age preacher hackman who advises people to pray to that part of god within yourself theres the excop borgnine who busted a hooker stella stevens six times then married her theres the hippie singer theres got to be a morning after who turns to the company of a lonely man red buttons once her brother is killed and to round out the group the elderly couple jack albertson and shelley winters who live aboard the ship the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship everyones in the giant ballroom at the time shortly past midnight of the new year when the ship turns first on its side then completely upside down the second incommand wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship in this case because the ship is overturned the top is the bottom or is the bottom the top either way we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and in the ballroom scene christmas trees thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors through burning rooms etc while the ship slowly fills with water behind them its a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at with all the melodrama that comes inbetween the nonthrilling action scenes the one note in borgnines onenote performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love although since there isnt a sex scene we never find out if his buttons really are red and albertson and winters wonder if theyll live to see their grandsons birth shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along winters who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie stevens even notso affectionately calls her fatass in one scene finally finds her purpose i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen she brags and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years shes swimming through the water her skirt billowing up around her hips showing off her cellulite or do you call it shellulite ridden thighs its not so much funny as innately disgusting which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole 
while watching loser it occurred to me that amy heckerlings true genius as a filmmaker is casting in fast times at ridgemont high she gave us sean penns jeff spicoli in look whos talking she turned bruce willis into a wisecracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival in clueless she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is or was alicia silverstone she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws unfortunately she may also be starting to understand that she understands giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal is the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser naturally heckerling makes her protagonist an allaround swell guy paul tannek jason biggs is a smalltown boy who gets a scholarship to nyu then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the coldhearted big city paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman his roommates adam zak orth chris tom sadoski and noah jimmi simpson are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar in this case the lovely dora diamond mena suvari dora has problems of her own including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor edward alcott greg kinnear thats more than slightly onesided theyre two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people so clearly they belong together even if paul is a loser i must confess that for a while i was suckered in by heckerlings casting jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence theyre pleasant enough to watch and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists arent then it gradually becomes clear that theres virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort in theory loser is a romantic comedy but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film notable exception a cameo by a scenestealing comic actor as a video store clerk instead of taking any time to make the characters situations funny heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters situations pathetic she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless nor any of that films interest in lively plotting not surprisingly since cluelesss plot came via jane austens emma she simply turns the film into a pity party since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character you might think that those characters would be interesting or at least slightly complicated instead you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that theres no reason to watch them paul isnt just a nice guy hes flawless consequently hes a central character who does absolutely no growing his roommates arent just inconsiderate theyre actively evilblackmailing professor alcott drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name and professor alcott isnt just manipulative he turns dora into his house slave doras unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser and even that isnt explored in sufficient detail theres more ambiguity in the 30second snippet from alan cummings broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser its one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations its another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow i dont know comic still i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkels scarborough faircanticle instead of giving the sequence a knowing winka reference to the graduate a hint that paul is becoming an overlysensitive clichheckerling plays it deadly straight even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonists foibles she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint cluelesss cher had her selfabsorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness in loser amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness her one show of wit involves naming pauls dorm hunts hall after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall her gift with casting proved to be her curse loser may be a crashing bore but gee arent those two kids swell 
capsule john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving he must find some sign of hope in the people of newfoundland this is little more than a tv skit in movie form it is watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in canada but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market it is diverting but hardly a serious piece of cinema 0 4 to 4 minor spoilers in this review written and directed by john w doyle john the baptist sent to st john newfoundland gets an invitation to live with a family that extraordinary hospitality for some reason does not count as a reason for hope script has a lot of holes friend who adopts john is surprisingly militant and is planning actions to destabilize wall street john does look middle eastern but somehow one expects john the baptist to be more dramatic there is a conspiracy in the vatican riding on the result of the visit though that result seems small compared to the end of the world big yucks like seeing a nun give the pope a pedicure and evil popes aid praying to a mendes goat in large part a satire of life in newfoundland taking licks at things like the poor produce the one good tomato in grocery by virtue of a miracle must have fallen off the truck to toronto based on a 20minute short film 
the disney sticktowhatyoudobest rule states that disneys animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at liveaction kids entertainment they will fail miserably this goes double for occasions when they try to make a liveaction adaptation of a popular cartoon remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations im still trying to forget that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget an insulting despicable and worst of all expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable childrens film it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes its films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet his career takes a nosedive to hell with his role as john brown a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush dr brenda bradford joely fisher but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr brendas father dr brenda has been working on a gadget project which would make a halfman halfmachine superpoliceman to fight crime feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject realizing his dream of becoming a policeman now when he says go go gadget insert name of gizmo here he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks bang up bandits and mangle murderers in the meantime the evil claw rupert everett the man responsible for the murder of the good doctors father is building a gadget of his own a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john browns worst nemesis claw has plans of world domination which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile voice of d l hughley to save humanity from his wrath state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this 90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal all of the expensive fx amounts to nothing part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie can kids really admire a hero so goodytwoshoes that he screams hey you ran a stop sign while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle i think that todays children will respond better to somebody dashing someone ultracool they probably receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt in addition to the more complex complaints above theres also the simple stuff inspector gadget is boring formulaic and achingly implausible theres no feeling that the director really cares about his story more than any other film ive seen this year this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line theres a popular commercial for sprite but thats irrelevant running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious thank god movie called death slug each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tiein slug taco slug on a stick at the end one of them asks what about the movie another answers well we dont have a script yet but we can bang one out by friday they probably could have replaced death slug with inspector gadget this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script its no coincidence that most good childrens entertainment these days comes from animation animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless sloppy and impersonal the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products 1999 eugene novikov137 
as the twin surfer dudes stew and phil deedle lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother yanking out his iv he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brothers face this bit of lame physical humor is typical of disneys meet the deedles a movie more to be endured that watched i stopped looking at my wife during the screening since every time i did shed start sticking her finger in her throat and shes right it is that bad directed without any imagination by steve boyum whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction the film limps along at best boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts stunts and more stunts amazingly for someone with his background he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones and we have a car go off the road five different times maybe more but whos counting and then there is the script by james herzfeld whose only other film tapeheads from a decade ago was so awful that it is considered a cult classic meet the deedles however is painfully bad rather than laughably bad it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes your geysers a geezer and id like to put a deedle in her haystack as the movie opens the twins who at one point describe themselves modestly as a walking kodak moment are celebrating their 18th birthday as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laidback beach bums into men as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone theyve got their surfboards skateboards and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire their camp has gone out of business but they are mistaken for new park rangers the rest of the movie has them fighting the parks overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged exranger played by dennis hopper who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration scheduled for later in the week hopper who has made some wonderful movies carried away being a recent favorite does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material this isnt his worst acting but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie hes ever been in steve van wormer and paul walker as stew and phil give lifeless performances the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull to add insult to injury hennings is fond of inappropriate closeups which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog put a tenfoot pair of lips on the screen and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movies stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road they make it look like so much fun that im sure many will try some variation of the stunt how could this possibly be worst asks phil just when you suspect it cant the movie takes a turn further downhill its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag after phils girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil they suck in a long worm like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp their lips finally meet in a kiss as they pull back their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas both almost 9 gave the show they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo 
bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment chris columbus the director who gave you mrs doubtfire plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point based on the short story by isaac asimov it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human which as you can imagine is very difficult starting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children soon this robot called andrew robin williams shows abilities that makes his owner mr martin sam neill very curious andrew is interested in art and music he enjoys making clocks which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions it shows out that because of a small failure in the electrical circuits and positronic brain andrew has accidentally gained a soul this makes him unique and his evil creators worried then mr martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasnt programmed to do soon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom destiny and love this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction ever since that film the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy what makes us human the thoughts the emotions is it possible to become human at what point can we say to a robot now you are one of us these are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach it is obvious that columbus didnt take them very seriously when you think about it this film is not really meditating on the question when is a robot no longer a machine but a human being but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding andrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being and only the society has troubles with it in other words it is as far from reality as from the academy awards further more there are other annoying problems to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now this has not been done for obvious reasons because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task columbus is the first to have crossed that line the result is as you might imagine primitive unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort the world is simply frozen in time neither the society fashion culture or values have changed over 200 years mom is still working at the kitchen doing the dishes when you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today youll see a slightly bigger difference i am not saying that everything should change it is unlikely that the human rights will change but its even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science technology and fashion i suppose its possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale but its really hard robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way as always he does a decent job as does sam neill but it doesnt really matter it is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience pretty much like last years meet joe black this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesnt deserve great actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten when isaac asimov wrote this story the future seemed far away and magical everything seemed possible now is the future of asimovs time and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago for the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius vernes 20 000 leagues under the sea so cant we accept this story as a potential reality let us hope that next years a i will be more rewarding 
in the continuation of warner brothers franchise joel schumacher has successfully killed this cash cow what makes this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsmans screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project as the client is such a shock that it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke situations are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the characters from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstones batgirl who just happens to be alfreds niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little subplot escapes me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she joins with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the characters have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier films now that he has an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homilies about family and relationships while at the same time not really having any george clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workmanlike is to be generous his best performances are still on e r bruce wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruces latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion as there was for nicole kidmans psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now hes just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batmans partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robins attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of 15 his later flirtation with batgirl smacks of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris odonnell once considered a rising star successfully burns up on reentry with this performance his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstones performance the better this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings us to the villains arnold scharzenegger walks through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freezes imprisonment the guards are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film its almost as ludicrous as seeing michael jackson as a gang member umu thurman struts and coos her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy has all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette 1978 the only performances worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacies of the plot there is one question that always comes to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor ones have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to its tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the pows gwaaaas and clangs associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalties from this film the special effects by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary stars of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivys lair the batcave to freezes hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for years to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effects have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair camera angles are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shots pepper the action scenes destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just has to look back on the films the lost boys cousins an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin comes off as a mated made for tv movie the film has no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jello pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with its surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumachers batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring stars 
long ago films were constructed of strong dialogue original characters memorable plot points and solid acting one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is this opus about the power of love and the redemption of family follows the tragic and i mean tragic life of novalee nation natalie portman hitting the road with her hick guitarplaying boyfriend in a rustedout gm novalee dreams of the blue skies of bakersfield and sipping chocolate milk beneath a plastic umbrella with her unborn baby due in a month stopping off at a nearby walmart for a quick rest novalees boyfriend decides to take off and leaves her there novalee then decides to secretly hole up in the walmart because shes not the brightest bulb in the stagelights a wacky librarian keith david comes to her rescue when she goes into labor one night while she is camped in the outdoors section of the store then the she moves in with a family befriends everyone in town including ashley judds character who has five kids and still can work parttime as a nurse fights off religious freaks survives a tornado breaks the heart of the wacky librarian that saved her receives an inheritance builds a martha stewartesque house becomes an awardwinning photographer and manages to always look like she stepped out of a cosmo shoot all while not once doing anything with her kid this film is terrible the directing is awful it seems director matt williams had an index card with six angles written on it and used every one of them over and over and over again we get pathetic and ugly acting by natalie portman who can do good work a disjointed pacing of key scenes and a time structure so confusing that it would throw steve prefontaine off a subplot that actually validates the actions of the boyfriend who abandoned novalee in the walmart parking lot an embarrassing display of emotions by the characters making the audience ill taking two great comedic screenwriters babaloo mandel and lowell ganz and forcing them to write drama on par with oprahs book club altogether it has the feeling of being trapped at home watching a very bad television miniseries and wishing it to end only the remote is broken however the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up where is the heart no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk 
stars armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr charlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chambers judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma childs mpaa rating r review in the 1982 updating of mickey spillanes 1947 novel i the jury hardboiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am dresses like don johnson in miami vice with less pastels and has sworn off alcohol however he still smokes his lucky strikes detests all forms of authority and kills at a whim beyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy pageturner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers the movie starts off with a bang a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick downs a onearmed detective and hammers best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jacks death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chambers paul sorvino he is immediately on the killers trail here the movie splits completely from the book and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia the cia one of hammers vietnam vet buddies and a kinky sex clinic many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different roles for instance charles kalecki alan king a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book turns into a suave mob boss and more importantly hammers suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from a runofthemill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic i the jury is one of several cinematic renditions of spillanes books including a 1953 version which was made in 3d but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywoods production code although this takes the 1982 version of i the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book rest assured the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward women it features one woman having her neck slashed a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot pointblank in the belly by hammer himself no one would deny that spillanes writing has a definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment its constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling its no surprise that the movie like the book fades to black with a dead woman on the floor i the jury had a troubled production and was not wellsupported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didnt do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made the script was written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies like its alive 1974 and its two sequels q 1981 and the stuff 1985 cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well but he was yanked from the directors chair after only a weeks worth of shooting because he was already 100 000 over budget he was quickly replaced by richard t heffron who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it shows in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron has none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scenes ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie features numerous car chases shootouts and stunts but heffrons background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and fullfrontal nudity i the jury takes on the air of a madefortv quickie with no real punch or depth but the problems in i the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person hammers character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no firstperson voiceover narration and some scenes dont have hammer in them at all consequently a great deal of the texture of spillanes storytelling is lost the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammers moral code is thrown to the wind despite his characterization as a hardnosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code the title itself i the jury refers to his antiestablishment notion of being his own law unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen as above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer comes off not only as amoral in societys terms but in any terms especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful maybe the scene was intended for laughs but it only cheapens hammers character and is by all accounts a lousy way to start the movie the blame for hammers character cant be laid on assantes shoulders because despite some unnecessary marlon brandonlike mumbling he delivers a fine performance spillane never once described hammers physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillanes books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations spillane who played the character himself in 1963s the girl hunters is generally considered the best of the film hammers the rest of actors are most unnoteworthy with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in i the jury were upandcomers who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had a short stint on dallas in the mideighties which only adds to the madefortv atmosphere of the film maybe someday someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book but this is certainly not it 
nostalgia for the 70s continues as we see a revival of one of the decades greatest achievements the marijuana comedy however half baked doesnt quite run with all its brain cells and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more the plot follows the misadventures of four neerdowell stoners theres the groups unofficial leader thurgood david chappelle scarface guillermo diaz brian jim breuer and kenny harland williams kenny gets into trouble when while on a munchie run feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse when the animal keels over he finds himself accused of killing a police officer and facing a 1 000 000 bail his friends promise to raise money for a 10 bail bond but have no idea how that is until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson clarence williams iii for a comedy the film is pretty humorless not that it doesnt try its just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat the four leads are nearly all playing the same character only williams stands out while still performing on the level of his humorfree comedy rocket man but that is because hes imprisoned throughout most of the film giving a much needed change of pace but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another to help out the film is packed full of cameos steven wright tommy chong janeane garofalo willie nelson snoop doggy dogg and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another none of them work beyond the simple hey thats level in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle not as his bland pothead lead but in his second role as a potobsessed rapper sir smokealot granted its pretty much a onejoke role and there arent a ton of laughs but this film needs every one it can scrape up to top it off and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film thurgood is given a love interest mary jane rachel true her role is that of the public service announcement to inform us why doing drugs including pot is wrong her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the your film promotes the use of drugs camp the film would have been better off by sticking with the rebel tone it so eagerly tries to claim yet in the end it doesnt really matter watching the film clean and sober you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is

anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landons fact based novel the king and i and its big expensive and soulless though goodlooking its lavish sets fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meersons script so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting this is jodie fosters first movie since the jawdroppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isnt the best choice to show off her acting chops shes trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens the uptight widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam now thailand with her son to instruct the kings chow yunfat son in the ways of the west because the ways of england are the ways of the world the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family 58 kids with 10 more in the way impressive no the eldest prince is none too happy about this father have i offended you in some way why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher but soon gets to know anna and her stern motherwholovesyou personality better and comes to like her meanwhile siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britains doing which arouses suspicion in siam putting anna in an uncomfortable position she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the kings prejudices he though selfrighteous as ever cant help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly quietly develop affections for each other there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the kings younger daughters dies its your classic deathbed scene with the girls mournful eyes staring at her father who tries only semi successfully to maintain his composure anna then comes in and cries a bit the sequence was there for a purpose to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer im usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time i was just sitting there my emotions untouched this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren we never develop connections to the characters never given a reason to care this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant whose last film was ever after one of my favorites of 1998 i do not doubt tennants ability to put together a decent movie but anna and the king aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient the sets and scenery are gorgeous but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from 75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with largerthanlife awe i liked both foster and yunfat who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles fosters generally stoic persona serves her well here as she is playing a reserved formal and rather underdeveloped character yunfat is especially effective perfectly conveying the king of siams sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations the cast is great the director is talented and the budget is lavish but this illadvised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole this is an emotionless costume epic 
robin hood men in tights is another melbrooksproduced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit unfortunately robin hood men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles none of the fun acting of young frankenstein is devoid of the charm of spaceballs and is even lacking the good solid dialogue of history of the world it is in short one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks or anybody else produce the plot borrows heavily from the wellreceived kevin costner movie of last year robin hood prince of thieves this is not surprising in and of itself and could have been used to great comic effect mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie mel brooks does not take advantage of this however and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air none of which connect and none of which are explained later on the movies scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice cary elwes of princess bride fame plays robin of loxley a man who was captured in the crusades fighting with king richard he escapes and joining with a man named achoo i am sure you can see the obvious joke fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard which has been captured by evil prince john played by funny comic richard lewis he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil sheriff of rottingham a good adventure plot that is sadly unused elwes and lewis are both excellent comics but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating neither actor has any good words to work with and the lines simply arent funny nor believable perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas that i really felt like leaving the theatre much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout and some left the theatre chuckles were few and far between and they mostly dealt with visual jokes such as an old beaten up horse from rentawreck then from any dialogue whatsoever scenes that could have been classics such as the archery contest are ruined by poor acting perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive the basic plot that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian is not witty nor funny mel brooks as a circumcisiongiving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience not all jewish either the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails the addition of a blind man who stumbles around falling off cliffs walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential but is also made terribly offensive the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard he is well worth waiting for if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue excruciating visual humor old puns ancient jokes and bad acting if you cant dont even bother watching this miserable film 
with his successful books and movies michael crichton is doing well with early successes with westworld 1973 and coma 1978 and recent films such as jurassic park 1993 his films have been entertaining however he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere this 100 million mess by good director barry levison disclosure is dull long winded and a huge disappointment considering the huge budget the all star cast and a story by crichton sphere is majorly disappointing the film opens with norman goodman hoffman a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors however when he arrives he his told by supervisor barnes peter coyote that he is actually investigating an spacecraft along with goodman is mathematician harry adams jackson biologist beth halperin stone and ted fielding liev schrieber they investigate the spaceship find a massive sphere inside meet an alien intelligence called jerry and basically weird crap happens unfortunately something went wrong along the way with sphere the film starts off entertaining enough but throughout this very long movie it just gets sillier and sillier the film jaunts along from scene to scene never fully explaining what is going on the actors and directing dont help either hoffman is on autopilot and almost seems embarrassed throughout the movie churning out dull lines and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie stone is useless displaying no emotion and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson whos funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere but hes hardly in it and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone the same goes for peter coyote who hams it up as the officer but is then killed off halfway through the director barry levinson who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure 1994 messes up with the drama and the action the drama scenes are quite frankly boring and the action scenes suffer from overkill with levison throwing the camera all over the place much like the godawful speed 2 1997 the writing doesnt help much either although crichton is great with plots hes terrible with dialogue and practically every line in sphere is a dud the speech is too simple i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent practically every line is just stating the obvious none of it is smart also where the hell did the budget go the sphere itself is impressive and theres a few nice special effect shots but where the 100 million went is anyones guess theres a giant squid attack in the picture but not once does the audience see the squid even though the film has a massive budget i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid and if handled correctly it probably would but the whole scene is done badly and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid finally the film has no idea what genre to be levison cant handle his own plot it leaps from hokey scifi to horror and finally the shiningevent horizon psychological thriller and of course the film is very much like the abyss 1988 although in its defense crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released and is far superior to this rubbish its not all that bad though the plot is all right theres a few jump scenes although nothing very scary and theres the occasionally interesting bit but overall sphere is a big waste of some fine talent a lot of money and a potentially good movie not really worth seeing overall rating review by david wilcock 
director luis mandokis last film was the superb serious 1994 drama when a man loves a woman but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture message in a bottle which is the worst type of romance a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense and the film ultimately moves at such a very very deliberate pace as if it is trying to make great meaningful statements and plot developments that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through message in a bottle begins with theresa osborne robin wright penn a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and to her objection finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper soon a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks a boating town in north carolina to find out the specifics of the message of course garrett turns out to be a handsome rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner she is immediately charmed by him but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there and finds that catherine was garretts late wife who died a few years earlier do you think you know where this is headed most likely you do and i wouldnt call it giving away anything to say that by the pictures end the movie has fallen into deep artificial melodrama that i didnt buy for a second if there are any positive things to say about message in a bottle it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman as garretts stubborn but loving father are far above par to be in such a wasteful shaggy dog love story and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast and paints chicago as an equally alluring city meanwhile costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar films that he has made recently it seems that with such bad luck he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water but here he is again with one of the main and most ridiculous centerpieces set on a stormswept sea the other actors are all sadly wasted including illeana douglas an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the friend roles here playing penns confidante and coworker at the tribune the first half of message in a bottle plays like a humdrum trite television movie for the lifetime channel as theresa spends a great deal of time getting to know garrett with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining usually i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt written and not as if people were really talking when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other and are not particularly interesting themselves you know immediately that you are in trouble i swear that while watching message in a bottle i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater heck in actuality im not even familiar to the novel this is based on by nicholas sparks always one step ahead of the characters the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresas secret and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after this same exact problem occurred in last years very very similar watch this and you will realize just how similar i mean meg ryannicolas cage romantic drama city of angels although theresa is deeply touched by the heartfelt letter that she finds in the bottle perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own preferably before filming began it should have read memo to screenwriters use you brain 
i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago i guess my memory really sucks there is very very little that is funny in caddyshack the laughs are few and far between and what there are really arent that great caddyshack as the name implies more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club michael okeefe plays said caddy why they cast this unknown fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me the movie doesnt seem to have a real plot just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera the only real story if you can call it that was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper bill murray who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera with painfully limited success bill murray is slightly amusing in places but fairly wasted the biggest waste of all is chevy chase who didnt even crack a smile on my face with his characters lame zenlike approach to golfing there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie i guess thats what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid im not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper nothing about this movie works it wouldnt have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasnt going to fly most of the scenes just couldnt possibly be funny its as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world im sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny in reality they were painfully embarrassing to watch there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the hot babe of the movie walking by in her bikini olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny but for the rest of us stay the hell away from caddyshack 
tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse the fugitive not quite this is the plot for double jeopardy another fugitive copycat without the action excitement and good acting that the original had there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall clever huh oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband bruce greenwood who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man both movies are on video make the wise choice and pick the fugitive there are so many flaws in double jeopardy it is laughable while serving time in prison libby parsons judd discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice learning that her husband is still alive she decides to serve her time in prison find him retrieve her son and kill her husband if necessary when the strict parole officer travis lehman jones stands in her way libby decides to break the rules who knows why and continue her plan despite the fact that if she gets caught shes going back to jail director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son every other scene we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture in an action movie like this valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend i miss my son nothing more nothing less dr kimble of the fugitive didnt look at one picture of his dead wife his primary concern was to save himself libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this they will be typecast for the rest of their careers kind of like their doomed costar tommy lee jones winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his idomyjobwhethertheyareinnocentorguilty roles people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right though i dont think he will win another oscar again the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count burglary assault grand theft auto are some of libbys slipups the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as youre innocent of the major crime hopefully criminals wont use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent that would just be plain stupid 
while i am not fond of any writers use of cheap easy puns i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it witness my review of pecker from a couple of issues ago so here goes the juvenile collegeset black comedy deadmanoncampus is dead on arrival straitlaced med student josh tom everett scott who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout s blemishfree academic record breaks out into fs thanks to the influence of his everpartying roommate cooper markpaul gosselaar who introduces josh to the sex and boozefilled nights that come with university life with the threat of losing an academic scholarship josh and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming cooper what are two goodhearted slackers to do easylook for a loophole which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a students or students roommate commits suicide the surviving student s shall receive straight as so instead of studying josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there move him into their dorm room and drive him to suicide before the semester ends director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and coopers diabolical plot until then the usual boring cliches of college life booze sex more booze fill the time which is made to feel longer by savedbythebell alumnus gosselaars sitcombred mugging that said once cohn and company do build some comic momentum they mishandle it the introduction of the manic psychotic cliff lochlyn munro a potential roommate for josh and cooper brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates paranoid nerd buckley randy pearlstein and british death rocker matt corey page one wishes that cliff would reappear but as they say be careful what you wish for not surprisingly he does resurface and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose almost immediately his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty the same can be said about all of deadmanoncampus whatever morbid appeal the farfetched premise has quickly evaporates and the selfabsorbed characters especially cooper pretty much grate from the getgo deadman doesnt grow tiresome it already is once the clever opening titles are through as it slogs along to a cheesy happyforallparties conclusion deadman lives up to its title and then somenot only does the movie grow even more tired and die it still insists on going on like a zombie 
boy what a great movie keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together the director of the fugitive andrew davis back again to give us another thriller and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot how could this not be a blockbuster all diehard keanu reeves fans read on ol much ado about nothing plays eddie kasalivich a machinist studying at the university of chicago to help pay for the rent he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university by happy coincidence he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics this project holds great promise taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in a potential solution to the earths energy problems without the pollution cost surely nobody could have any problems with that morgan freeman is paul shannon the projects sponsor he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly so he murders the project leader blows up the project great but short scene here sort of like a mini id4 citydevastation thing and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hitech hushhush location unfortunately our intrepid machinist and an english physicist weisz manage to get away and now follows a fugitivelike chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script this movie is just dying for a comparison with the fugitive both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesnt change much i guess we cant really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward credit to them but we arent really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences which frankly get quite boring after a while harrison ford was the man against the world he was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well in chain reaction keanu reeves isnt alone now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia vulnerability and confusion we dont get this we get him thinking hes still in speed only now our sandra bullock has an english accent probably doesnt drive a bus and hardly contributes anything to the movie the producers here probably thought hey what if keanu and rachel dont hit it off too well lets rope in that morgan to help us out well keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen and most unfortunately morgan freeman doesnt help much either the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder its not really his fault once again andrew davis just doesnt take the time to build his characters someone must have convinced him that this time round cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken the flying inkpot rating system wait for the tv2 broadcast a little creaky but still better than staying at home with gotcha pretty good bring a friend amazing potent stuff perfection see it twice 
there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling hapless straight man from the hysterical naked gun films crack an immediate smile and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof hes committed himself to starring in since the wavering movie spoofs however are less forgivable to be fair wrongfully accused the sendup in question and nielsens third parody since the last gun isnt quite as excruciatingly humorless as his dracula dead and loving it or spy hard which is a mighty good thing nielsen is still in tiptop comedic form able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them and he needs one very soon wrongfully accused meshes together the premises of the fugitive and patriot games casting its always game star as ryan harrison get it a master violinist who is drawn into an affair with a married temptress kelly le brock she however sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband michael york a crime actually committed by a onearmed onelegged oneeyed man aaron pearl harrison is arrested found guilty and sentenced to death but escapes from a prison bus of course and then is pursued by a determined u s marshal named fergus falls richard crenna unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones already smirky oscarwinning role theres also a mystery brunette melinda mcgraw and an assassination subplot involving the u n secretary general but like any of it matters wrongfully accused gets off to an assured start with an inconcert nielsen touted lord of the violin by barechested posters pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedoclad mosh in front of the stage nice touch most of the scenes that follow however never top the opener hysterical exceptions the mentos and baywatch goofs movie parodies are crammed in at an almostsubliminal rate but most are empty when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la anaconda or baseball players disappear into a field of dreams esque cornfield theres really nothing to laugh at other moments like an interlude in a fishing shop are so unfocused that youre not sure what youre supposed to be laughing at there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied sendups here so its possible that directorwriter pat proft by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two guarantees something is sure to stick and what does stick sticks well particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hardboiled dialogue what those naked gun s which proft collaborated on did great these bits are so ontarget that they allow you to remember wrongfully accused as an almosthalfwaythere spoof instead of a lamebrained failure the movie might have been cursed to begin with opening fast on the heels of mafia from proft colleague jim abrahams and baseketball from proft colleague david zucker but its a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing wrongfully accused of being nielsens funniest 
please dont mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam i just want to warn all of yall not to waste your hardearned on anaconda its not even worth a 99cent video rental dont listen to ebert on this one he has no clue what hes talking about btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was required to watch it on assignment she reviews movies for a local paper now ill actually back up my huffing and puffing here goes movie anaconda rydains bottom line wait for it to come on usa up all night even then i doubt its worth the price of jolt to help you stay up that late why do i hate anaconda let me count the ways first of all this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong as an ophiophile snake lover i can tell you that a anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet b theyre scared of people c cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snakes mouth and constrictor snakes dont kill what they cant eat d people can outrun snakes with no trouble especially heavy ones like anacondas e if an anaconda did eat a human it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal therefore it couldnt run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast and f snakes have no vocal cords so they cant make funny squealing noises whew i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it unfortunately anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didnt give up and fall asleep he was the most likable character in the movie who wouldnt enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman anaconda did have its cute moments arguments between ice cubes character and the british guy for instance however those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twentyeight minutes of boring schlock the writers had and blew a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny did she retort with a clever egowithering comeback of course not im trying to work gee thats even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with she could have told him to go find a knothole or something p but i will admit there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome hint it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks as for the plot im still trying to find one this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous computergenerated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the fasterthangravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet harrier snake not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense in which the sick guys gfriend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him that was about as clear and understandable as mission impossible if someone could explain that movie to me id be most grateful all the oldguy double agents looked the same i wasnt inspired by the acting save for the evil dude i cant blame the actors though its not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with this concludes rydains diatribe on a shameless exploitation and perpetuation of public fear of snakes comments flames anyone rydain the atomic cheese fresh from chernobyl dairies 
this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be one of the hottest writers in hollywood he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream 810 then added the successful i know what you did last summer 7 510 script to his mix and also created the popular tv series dawsons creek so when he asked to direct his first movie based on his first ever script written everyone and their grandma said sure go for it uhhm my question is did anyone bother reading this stupid script plot ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west mrs tingle and set to lose her scholarship to college when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story they end up tying her up and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman critique its not so much that this is a bad movie than the fact that it sucks this movie is chockfull of onedimensional characters contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on zero tension or thrills plot holes the size of my big ass lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie and molly ringwald vivica a fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery 810 and 9 to 5 but unfortunately for williamson he went nowhere with the bright foundation making references to the exorcist and dr zhivago which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate he also forgot about suspense with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue sure katie holmes is cute and her costar marisa coughlan did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist worth two points out of my three on ten but how can we forgive the biggest onedimensional character in any film holmes rival in the film mrs tingles complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays and a transparent romance between holmes and some longhaired dude hired to be the poor mans version of skeet ulrich who himself is a poor mans version of johnny depp all in all this movie was laughable for me provided me with no insight into anything demonstrated williamsons genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability humanity or capacity to comprehend no hip lines no cheap thrills just a dull time at the movie theater if you want to see a funny teenage movie go see detroit rock city 810 and thank my drunken sorry ass in the morning little known facts about this film and its stars kevin williamsons father was a fisherman kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer 7 510 he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally so is dawson leery on tvs dawsons creek a show kevin created he was once an aspiring actor in fact he even landed a bit part on tvs another world also williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs tingle which is also loosely based on the book killing mr griffin by the writer of i know what you did last summer 7 510 lois duncan he has also come out and said that he is a gay man helen mirren was born in london england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff she is married to director taylor hackford whose works include devils advocate 810 and an officer and a gentleman 8 510 this film was originally titled killing mrs tingle but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called wasteland this is actor barry watson first full feature film he has played the character of seth on tvs malibu shores several times 
in a typical cinematic high school the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them but not before the boys scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books as the sexual acts take place the other guys hang out nearby guzzling beer and grunting like pigs in the rage carrie 2 robert mandels terminally bland sequel to carrie there isnt a single original moment only amy irving returns from carrie and the talent of the rest of the sequels cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreus script as rachel the horror storys lead emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory but it isnt exactly her fault the director asks for little from his actors which is precisely what he gets sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim her fellow students delight in tormenting her of course she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers as the movie marks time until its big finale it throws in some repugnant scenes hoping to turn audiences stomachs rachels girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made love to her the night before spurns her he gets major points in his black book for this but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death even a helpless puppy is run over and we see his poor little body flipping over and over under a truck the teenagers in the movie are completely blas about it all doesnt it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday asks one of the few kids with a conscience why responds his nonplussed girlfriend she wasnt anybody remarkably devoid of any energy especially for a horror flick the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theaters armrest with material this bad the films only hope is to go for parody but it isnt smart enough to realize it even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie the rage carrie 2 runs 1 45 it is rated r for graphic violence teen alcohol abuse sex nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers 
man this was one wierd movie similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldnt decide which genre it is the first hour is your standard stock aliens clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship the last half hour this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it lets just kill everybody from then on forget scifi this movie becomes 100 horror what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare this movie just uses loud noises sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore yawn everyones seen it all before and knows when to expect it the one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew there are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed but what did this then finally after being painfully restored the new crew views the video the acting isnt too bad at all considering what the actors had to work with anyway as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space this movie could have been so much better it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with there was just nothing new here that any of us havent seen before in aliens or hellraiser 
the king and i a warner brothers animated musical feature recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king with obvious results when anna miranda richardson a british schoolteacher travels to saim to educate the kings martin vidnovic children she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly and must say something to the greedy ruler meanwhile the kings prime minister ian richardson the stereotypical villain plots to overthrow the king taking the throne the last and most predictable main subplot deals with the kings son allen d hong and his love for a servant tuptim armi arabe and how he conflicts with his feelings and the ancient laws of saim not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent as the king and is problems could fill the blank pages of a journal i will only note the major difficulties for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail the screenplay written by arthur rankin peter bakalian jacqeline feather and david seidler which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory as every time the obnoxious king would shout etc etc etc i would cringe literally speaking of cringing i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking besides the repetitive dialogue from the king on the whole the songs seem out of place and unlike the lyrics are unmagical the sole song which is used cleverly is getting to know you which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors which they have never been exposed to unlike disney animated features the king and is songs dont add to the film and are as uneffective as could be take the following scenario as an example as the sheer horror of the king and is music is at its worst youre being hunted by a dragon what do you do sing a happy song martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion you hear the saying two negatives dont make a positive believe it with the terrible dialogue that the king has along with his awful voice track the king is completely unbelievable only shows mild signs of any personality and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says etc etc etc more and more as the film progresses no personality at the beginning of the movie none at the end and where does this characters personality change hey i thought anna was supposed to change him isnt that the whole plot the prime ministers hideous sidekick darrell hammond brings his share of cringes as well oh no another one of his teeth fell out hardyharhar he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him by the way this review is going you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films hence why i hate this movie because the king and i is a disgrace to animation animated films such as 1994s the lion king and 1998s the prince of egypt are among my favorite movies of all time the animation team does design their share of well animated settings so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds i have not read the play or seen the oscar winning 1956 film adaption but from what i can tell the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play for the king and i is never magical nor interesting if it wasnt for miranda richardson who voices anna with feeling the king and i could earn the title worst movie of the decade instead the king and i will just go down as among the years worst the bottom line avoid this movie at all costs not even young children the target audience in this film will enjoy it not the slightest bit 
synopsis cromagnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggystyle ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate comments allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the scifi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese its so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that its oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dogeared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the socalled dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope its 10 000 times better than its film adaptation if not then im at a complete loss to explain its popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramps about in the woods with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audiences expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up aylas mother a blonde with fur pants er leggings tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well as the earthquake slowly recedes a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming sixyearold manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven i wont detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cromagnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesnt just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with a twobyfour a blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs shes of the new people theyre of the old people with the memories yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best makeup which surprises me the movie depends upon a lot of makeup obviously but much of it is unconvincing as stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the characters have dark makeup of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the facepainting thats occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from its new age trappings maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the films fauxmysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and a narrator who sounds like a psychic youd expect to hear on a 1900 number and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though its probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ive seen in quite a while it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous im sure its so cheesy that it probably wont bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however as i wrote at the beginning of this review it does have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottomofthebarrel films dealing with early man fantasy movies involving dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though its so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two stars i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however im only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise 
salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets actors who demand such salaries might be greedy but in some instances they are quite justified because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies and one fine example is breakaway 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring in famous figure skater tonya harding face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster one day she decides to retire but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that realising that her life suddenly became worthless myra starts running for her life followed by professional assassins terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities her acting leaves much to be desired on the other hand her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave bfilms a bad name martin sheens brother joe estevez whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set is the only bright spot of breakaway unfortunately he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya hardings silver screen debut proved to be her last film 
movies like six days seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents the script was written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new ideas hed rehash a lot of cliches omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drugdealing pirates to provide for a few highlevel action sequences and explosions there are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make see the truman show for instance six days seven nights is simply a waste lets see we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island so how do we do that well well make her a feisty magazine editor and well make him a crusty old pilot but wait she has to have a fianc e that can be david schwimmer but wait if she has a fianc e how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone i know theyll get to their vacation spot and then shell get called back yessssss so theyll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minutes shucks oh ive got it well throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo and then he can feel guilty then when anne heche kisses harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be a vindicated action because her fianc e will already have cheated on her then for no obvious reason theyll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them oh yes i feel so good about this story instead of using characterization to propel the events it will be completely random and yet totally predictable imagine that dont get me wrong six days seven nights is not a boring picture ford and heche both do a great job the sparks fly between them and so most of brownings inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors sheer force of talent almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen and i found myself laughing pretty hard schwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get and reitman who has made some good films at least tries to make things exciting even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences its just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces the picture feels like its been hacked to pieces i wouldnt be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely the ones that are here are as bad as they come i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships and id just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream why did you pick this awful script the film is outright stupid but some of the elements are subtly horrifying for instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo and then feels really guilty this is a serious problem in real life but six days seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story this is summer movie season but that doesnt mean our movies have to be dumb 1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory for summer blockbusters when i was in line for six days seven nights i heard the woman in front of me ask for two tickets to that new harrison ford movie why didnt she know the name of the film i suppose she just didnt care what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures dont realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves good actors should sign to good scripts and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that wed like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents 
if anything stigmata should be taken as a warning against releasing similarlythemed films relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst i suppose i should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasnt anything id lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtvinfluenced tripe i have seen in a long while no not really patricia arquette plays frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globetrotting mother as it turns out the rosary belonged to a recentlydeceased brazilian priest the priests church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering shes an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church as it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video i mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse indeed it would have been good if it were a music video because its only interesting for about five minutes im not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion doubleexposure and extreme closeups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headacheinducing what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what i can do im an excellent director maybe then hed explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slowmotion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didnt see it just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes a doubleexposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldnt bother me if stigmata had a story or characters that were remotely engaging though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we arent given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hardworking hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and shes kind of cute so lets start the bleeding the fact that shes clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesnt help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back go clubbing sure that makes sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so onedimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable even though frankie pages life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances father andrews religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic as for pryce he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle ill get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me im not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain whats worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesnt even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary how come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata actually im not sure what frankie was posessed by supposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time furthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrapup and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas youll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library theres nothing the catholics need to worry about though stigmatas religion is so offbase that it cant be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone allout and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting im not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means its rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does it s not thoughtprovoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be im not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe its an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the films many flaws im also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earthshattering when we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every fiveyearold learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it 
john boormans zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course woods career can be explained by two things he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his followup film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldnt know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly overconceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the fatherson jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything hes ambitious and when he succeeds its in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boormans his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz a book which figures into the movies plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the events take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movieness to be found in fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting oldstyle guns and living in large victorian mansions its more middle ages than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life these immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in a sort of quasiutopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years if someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals one of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts a godlike status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head this flying head is one of the movies opening images and its a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they cant procreate and take up more resources from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laughinducting statements like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movies cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardozs flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex once there the immortals label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up i say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward he didnt get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earpstyle handlebar mustache and a pair of thighhigh patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would greenlight this effort he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and its a wonder it didnt end his career im sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing or is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy 
the kids in the hall are an acquired taste it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies they would grow into the big screen my recommendation is that unless you are a big fan of the kids skip the film as it is their firstand most likely onlyattempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv a bigbudget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show the kids go through the motions but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression in typical sketchcomedy tradition each actor plays several roles doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals dr cooper releases the drug into the marketplace the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film at about 90 minutes brain candy still seems long the best thing about sketch comedyand the kids are no exceptionis the ability to quickly deliver the laughs then go on to another quick skit but with the additional setup necessary in telling a longer coherent story the laughs just dont come fast enough strangely the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv the movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced as if they have to live up to a pg rating one of the best bits though does make use of thompsons naked buttocks we see him charging into battlegoing to have sex with some guys taking a shower in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail the kids unfortunately are not up to the task there are some amusing moments to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one 
there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director of course his best film was 1978s masterpiece halloween but he also made 1980s the fog and 1987s underrated prince of darkness heck he even made a good film in 1995 with in the mouth of madness but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 with the terrible comedy memoirs of an invisible man somehow carpenter has lost his touch with junk like his failed 1995 remake of village of the damned to his uninspired 1996 sequel escape from l a those movies however look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film john carpenters vampires if i was him i definately wouldnt want to put my own name in the title it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as vampires the story is simple jack crow james woods is a vampire hunter who along with one of his partners montoya daniel baldwin and a prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith since katrina was previously bitten by him crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her it seems valeks mission is to steal a black wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out well the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made john carpenters vampires sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror films ive ever seen in fact there isnt even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105minute running time the nonstop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually a trademark of carpenters and then we come to the screenplay which as far as i can tell is nearly nonexistent there is no story development and there isnt even an attempt to flesh out the characters james woods can be a good actor but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of pseudo clever lines of dialogue daniel baldwin has some potential but his character comes off as being very dense and sheryl lee faring much better as laura palmer in twin peaks like all of the female characters plays an offensive stereotypical whore there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenters vamires which is very disheartening coming from an exfan of carpenters he has said that he turned down directing halloween h20 because he couldnt work up any excitement for it and yet when asked about a vampires sequel he said he would be happy to do it i think thats a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention a significant number of iq points

those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugos novel les miserables i dont know if a lot of people have though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel i havent even seen that going into this film i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters i even expected the film to be a musical walking away from it im kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material writerdirector bille augusts film version is a straightforward beautifully told film liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he has just been released from a 19year prison sentence he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior the priests words of wisdom influence him and he makes a vow to change himself nine years later we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo nobody knows his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago conflicts arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned to vigo valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean to be a convict javert is hellbent on upholding the law and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice along the way valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vows to take care of her daughter cosette played later by claire danes les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast and the sets dont look like sets they look like real towns and villages gabriella pescuccis costumes are noticeably spectacular basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually wellplaced though it does get a bit heavy at times many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality such as the climax which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening augusts keeps the story simple which i hear is a good thing since the novel is so complex and easy to follow he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately i was also impressed that he didnt go overboard with flash and style which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days such as baz luhrmanns vicious tragedy william shakespeares romeo juliet this film feels solid and whole and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested liam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective thurman in her small role is very good and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very nonglamorous role such as this one rush is absolutely incredible as javert i dont remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense i cant be as charitable for danes however though i know she is a talented actress here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit les miserables is as ive said a solid intelligent motion picture my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy and perhaps too staged each scene is grand and huge and exploding with poledouris score but i didnt always want them to be for the most part les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture its a good movie and tells its story well but august tends to handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle however in a film this exciting and wellproduced a few minor flaws are easily overlooked 
this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueffs play hospitality suite its about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention whose chicago company has sent them to wichita where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revels in salesmentalk among the three white christian males two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesmen having teamed together for the last twelve years while bob facinelli is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what comes into question is their opinions on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesmen films from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why hes on top and why they are chasing after him what makes this film different than the others is its blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do as both must sell their product and how after each ones psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in bob is a baptist who takes a very nonquestioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he reads the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and cant even say because he loves her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personalities is stark larry is all business he simply wants to close the sale he comes into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burnedout he tells him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in he has always been a charmer shaking everyones hand trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive as a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesnt arrive at the party the salesmen throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act as the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another mans name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil cant fathom how bob didnt make a sales pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fullers attention about their companys product as they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives these three performers were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see 
the coen brothers are back again this time with homers odyssey as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in o brother where art thou right for the beginning of o brother the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song the camera flows around the hard toiling men giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john turturro escaping across a cotton field it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio a strong suite as always with the coen brothers is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films their characters are goofy and comical like nicolas cage in raising arizona or dramatic as albert finney and john turturro in millers crossing and even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in fargo in all cases and in o brother too the characters populating their films are threedimensional people ulysses everett is a handsome hairobsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department but he seems like a genius when compared to the simple sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of 1 2 million their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homers original material as they meet all manner of people along the way including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money there is magic too when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys adventures giving the flick a choppy episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow some of the interludes are an epiphany though the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitarplaying tommy johnson chris thomas king and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere run by its blind owner stephen root they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and without their knowledge are recorded as they sing the traditional tune i am a man of constant sorrow it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us in my mind the best movie song of the year contrasting this and other wonderful moments the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of o brother in particular near the end is a scene where ulysses delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of the wizard of oz they dont say lions and tigers and bears oh my and theres no dorothy but it is the land of oz were seeing here the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels george clooney is funny charming a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today he has the charm of a 30s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical herowanderer while clooney is the name draw for o brother the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who at one point hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine the taciturn pete as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst all together the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons albeit brave ones the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys odyssey charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy odaniel who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for reelection john goodman is wicked as the oneeyed bible salesman and con artist big dan teague michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary george babyface nelson stephen root is amusing as the blind dj reping one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses estranged wife penny and the real reason for this adventure not secret treasure techs are as expected in a coen brothers venture first class cinematographer roger deakins who has worked on five previous coen films captures the sultry atmosphere of the south the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres respectively once again roderick jaynes the alter ego of ethan and joel coen is on board as editor the high points outweigh the low through most of o brother where art thou with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music i give it a b 
contact pg theres a moment late in robert zemeckiss contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place we see a scientist dressed in a silvery space suit walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact spherical space pod unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops anticipation excitement anxiety fearthe audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character nervously breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead it is this sense of discovery the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical captivating entertainment jodie foster stars as dr ellie arroway a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals and i mean lifeafter losing her entire family when she was young the only thing occupying ellies world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport from this synopsis contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the scifi hook the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe but perhaps more than anything else contact is a character study of ellie whose obsession with empirical scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power the irony is that while admitting to having no religious faith she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes in a sense a religion in its own right it would be easy for scripters james v hart and michael goldenberg in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones but they wisely eschew easy answers giving equal time to both sides and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane in the end there is no right or wrong nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other even slightly sothere are just two very viable points of view each with their own merits each with their own faults the complex role of ellie is an actresss dream and foster a virtual shooin for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year more than rises to the challenge she conveys intelligence determination warmth and in a gutsy move always on edge we root for ellie and feel for her but we also feel at times that she goes too far contact is clearly fosters vehicle but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles matthew mcconaughey who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss however his main storyline the tentative palmerellie romance is the films weakest subplot john hurt is effectively creepy as s r hadden the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine most memorable of all though are tom skerritt and james woods who play rival scientist dr david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz respectively both especially skerritt embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances zemeckis comes off of his threeyear break in top shape always known as a director of effectsladen extravaganzas it comes as no surprise that contacts visual effects are quite stunning the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 a space odyssey but with more advanced technology at his disposal zemeckiss voyage is even trippier than stanley kubricks yet more wondrously pure and zemeckis doesnt resist the urge to use the alwaysinteresting incorporateactorsintoexistingfilmfootage effect which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump effects however are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama emotion and pure wonder which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump it says a lot that in a summer science fiction film such as this its not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised the thoughtprovoking twohourplus contact is a muchwelcome change of pace from summer nobrainers but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isnt entertaining for all the interesting questions it asks the film is still what its being sold as a journey to the heart of the universe and what a fascinating unforgettable journey it is 
satirical films usually fall into one of two categories 1 longterm satire where everything including the jokes is somehow related on a large scale i e dr strangelove 2 situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene i e men in black whats unique about wag the dog is that it doesnt necessarily fit either of these descriptions and yet is both at the same time the result is a clever comedy based on an original smart premise even if the focus does tend to wander a bit if theres anything that affects americans the most its politics and showbusiness in this age of information and technology weve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things its gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it we need the media to bring us the most uptodate news but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas and then presents an interesting scenario if politics the media coverage of politics and the entertainment industry are so closely related couldnt someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all thats the idea conrad brean de niro a professional washington spin doctor comes up with in order to restore the presidents good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election brean along with the presidents top advisor winifred ames heche fly to california to meet up with hotshot movie producer stanley motss hoffman they pitch him an idea to produce the image of a war with albania its a country no ones heard of so they people will buy it soon the wheels are in motion and the films riffing satire comes into play were inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation such as a folk singer visual and sound effects technicians and a modern style expert known as the fad king leary the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv in the movies or in the news the characters dialogue is witty and funny although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcomesque for example one scene shows motss and breans production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs since its all computerenhanced anyway she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later this demonstrates the films ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise but then theres the gags and oneliners that although are humorous seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actresss name or whenever a problem emerges always responding with this is nothing by the time the film makes it to the midpoint everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens the first act is quickly paced while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with and its always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems headon in realistic manners however it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture what had started off as a brilliant somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie still the situation comedy is quite funny especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt willie schumann a war hero motss and brean concocted truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time but think about afterwards and wag the dog at least succeeds in this respect however in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes then again its a valiant effort 
after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project making the third installment in the godfathertrilogy this new film has been underrated for no reason it is as intellectual and majestically made as copollas pervious films it is also more psychological pessimistic and more tragic than the first two the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some unfinished developments of some characters the film elegantly begins with nino rotas recognizable musical score the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michaels voice as he is writing a letter to his children the only wealth in this world is children more than all money and power on earth you are my treasure the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of part ii to make his fathers dream come true making the corleone family legitimate michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling constantly haunted by the past his only reason to live is his children the family has amassed unimaginable wealth and as the film opens michael corleone al pacino is being invested with a great honor by the church later that day at a reception his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily a check in the amount of 100 million but the corleones are about to find as others have throughout history that you cannot buy forgiveness sure you can do business with evil men inside the church for all men are fallible and capable of sin but god does not take payoffs the plot of the movie concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican there is a moment in godfather iii where michael says all my life i have been trying to go up in society where everything was legal but the higher i go the crookier it becomes visually this film is as spectacular as the first two gordon willis rich cinematography carmine copollas beautiful composition and alex tavoularis wonderful art direction could not be better but copollas first two godfatherfilms were more famous for their deep intellectual plots tree dimensional characters and incredible acting than for their visual perfection the third installment has only the plot and visuals some characters could be much more developed and the acting although good never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie that could have been grander and more emotional the best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars andy garcia is powerful as sonnys son strong focused and loyal violence is natural to him he suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his familys behalf and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was however both kay diane keaton and connie talia shire are useless and characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed the good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends that you remember from the first and second films in the third film michael has become almost like his father vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger this parallel could be more interesting if vincenzos character was more developed many have pointed out that making the third film was unnecessary i disagree it is a beautiful film of great importance completing the tragic saga of the corleone family the first film showed some horrible results of corleones life it showed michael making a choice the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times a man desperately trying to keep his balance focus family and sanity while everything is crashing all around him the third film is a terrifying conclusion a result of michaels life the life he chose for himself is like quicksand one wrong step and you are doomed there is no turning back and no matter how hard you try to get out of it to free yourself no matter how powerful and wealthy you are you are helpless sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely the beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film when michael is sitting alone in his chair left by everyone surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead here he dies alone miserable and unforgiven 
bruce willis is a typecasted actor in die hard he played john mcclaine a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time again in pulp fiction as butch coolidge an overthehill boxer he steps on the wrong guys toes in luc bessons the fifth element willis plays korben dallas a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time a stylish science fiction epic the fifth elements complex plot begins right away in the deserts of egypt think stargate in 1914 an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the 5 elements are stored and takes them away vowing to return them when the evil comes back cut to present day which is our future the year is 2023 and new york is the city the only basic differences between bessons futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker the buildings are higher and the traffic floats anyway the evil comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth so back come the tortoiselike aliens to return the 5 elements to earth in order to defend themselves against the evil in the process however the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing when officials arrive at the site all that remains is a hand what can you do with a hand hey its the 21st century heredna reconstruction this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful but mysterious woman named leeloo milla jovovich dazed and confused she escapes and attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korbens floating cab its love at first site as korben and leeloo elude the lazyasalways cops when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ian holm night falls on manhattan korben searches the yellow pages and delivers her to the door of the good reverend the only man who knows of her background and duties now korben leeloo and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship special effects were spectacular here to find the remaining four elements it is here where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg gary oldman murder in the first he too wants possession of the elements as do a group of piglike warriors think the gamorreans in return of the jedi in a spectacular ending with time running out leeloo is faced with a problemwhy should she save a people who live to destroy each other the question is a good one and one that could be pondered but enough of that when korben points out his love for her leeloo is inclined to become the 5th element and save the world from total destruction the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain who reminded me a lot of jack nicholsons the joker in batman by one of the masters of villainy oldman and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich the supporting cast which includes brion james tango cash tim tiny lester no holds barred luke perry buffy the vampire slayer and chris tucker friday added a comedic effect to the film although bessons the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches it is a solid motion picture with a definite point some other directors like anacondas luis llosa should take a lesson from this guyusing ideas from epic motion pictures the right way ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film scifi fan or not any movielover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture 
there must be some unwritten rule that states one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of 1972 a 25yearold english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girls the 6yearold lucy carrie and the 8yearold bea bella has arrived for a years stay with the selfabsorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold oneroom london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers she has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesnt seem like its much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in drugs a worldwide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here in this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freuds granddaughter esther freud who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister it is written by the directors brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls the girls readily accept him and there is no bigtodo made about their openly sexual relationship but the girls really dont know what to make of the relationship it especially bothers bea who is embarrassed by her mothers loose attitude and wants to go home things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilals charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has a wife who still lives there this scene didnt make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many a dropout reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the familys travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts it will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldnt comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories a gift from god the films weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same babyboom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldnt have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the films strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girls are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who cares about the children but doesnt know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where shes at this is a very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done whos to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences just like she probably was 
did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward with a comatose sunny von bulow she is the main narrator of the film in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder the dramatic trick works as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder sex unhappiness and a lawyers moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win jeremy irons is claus von bulow in what is his finest role and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history he is as hated as any man alive as cold as a cucumber his remorse for his wifes comatose condition is nonexistant and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas 1980 the background to the case is such during christmas of 1979 sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke the same situation occured in 1980 only sunny never woke and probably never will when examined it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson convicted and freed on bail he immediately hires alan dershowitz the renowed harvard law professor to acquit him ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him we follow him through two very different cases the case of the johnson case where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didnt commit and von bulow who he still hasnt figured out dershowitz doesnt know what happened to sunny and he is extremely hesitant to take the case nevertheless he does based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him together with a group of law students dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed silvers performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film schroeder directs on many different levels with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz there are flaws at times the film gets overly theatrical yet due to glenn closes troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well the flashbacks are good but at times schroeder doesnt fill in the blanks the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film and it could have used a better ending the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly without any intelligent conclusion the supporting characters are often neglected and dershowitzs team should have been allowed to grow character wise but schroeder oversimplifies the story and the characters yet for all these flaws the film is deeply engrossing because of irons as von bulow he is brutally evil antisemitic prejudiced arrogant protective he is a rotten lying monster whose conviction may have been wrong legally but morally he was to blame irons plays him to a cold perfection with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder however the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wifes death by years of neglect and coldness however legally did he do the murder schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind with all the character flaws reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent he wants the viewer to make up his own mind schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow in death for all the failed dramatic theatrics this is one that works beautifully we dont know what happened that sense of legal ambiguousness along with von bulows obvious moral guilt is why reversalf fortune works in the end von bulow is as sadistic as ever irons is haunting and that is why reversal of fortune is so good 
driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small intimate story its a quiet film a slow film a deliberate film but if youre patient with it the movie offers innumerable rewards such as a pair of selfassured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhrys pulitzerprize winning play of the same name which first opened in new york four years ago the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza the film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years a cranky 70something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60something black man who becomes her chauffeur the movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action in fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesnt present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together rather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlantas history including the 1958 bombing of the temple the citys oldest jewish congregation and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr the story begins in 1948 with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway the insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her a chauffeur freeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature aging prejudice and a great many other things but more than anything its about a relationship one that spans 25 years 4 cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon daisy is strongwilled and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur initially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere once she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate backseat driver to make matters worse she is extremely selfconscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand eventually however daisy is worn down by hokes goodnatured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace weve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nevertheless tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own freeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color hoke is uneducated and illiterate but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element in full command of their natural charisma they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movies gentle humor at the same time tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama in his first dramatic role dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie tandys loving and patient son drama seems to agree with aykroyd taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ghostbusters ii the great outdoors my stepmother is an alien the only other significant characters in the film are daisys housekeeper idella marvelously played by esther rolle good times and boolies pretentious wife played by patti lupone under the direction of bruce beresford crimes of the heart tender mercies driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again but fortunately beresford never forgets hes shooting a movie and accordingly he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches such as gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say beresford wisely exercises restraint in the films dramatic moments the movie tugs at your heart but it never goes for the jugular the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees 
when people are talking about good old times they actually want to make some bad times look better nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s for new generations superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids for people who actually had to live in that period it was the gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of 1968 rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era martin scorseses taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all the movies protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro 26year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he cant sleep at nights the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantines presidential campaign their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre losing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster 12year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi as many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times for others the movie uses raskolnikovlike figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but doesnt have a stomachlack of brains to do it while de niros travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively 1970s feel wizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with americas better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade other characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age matthew sport keitel who befriended reallife pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime is dressed like a hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture porno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politicians like senator palantine are lost in postvietnam and postwatergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program cant fool even such idiots like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism cant be washed away even by ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schraders screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloidfodder because of hinckley and his reallife reenactment of events in the movie now more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory 
note ordinarily moviereviews org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as spoilers however being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews org feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations plot giveaways will appear in the following review if this bothers you please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now what does it take to play carnegie hall practice it takes two hours for music of the heart to play carnegie hall both figuratively and literally like the children it portrays the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a showstopping performance at the legendary concert hall roberta guaspari academy award winner meryl streep has two kids a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors that is the patternlike plot of this production ultimately the film chooses a zerosum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an alltime high when the men in her life finally vanish the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful robertas character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat also lacking depth is the films bad guy a narrowminded music teacher josh pais who rejects roberta out of principle the movie never explains exactly which principle that is and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre they are highlighted by one childs return to robertas class coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be cant be around anymore because my mom said and a glowing concert not knowing the running time you may expect the credits to role at this point but they dont instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent director wes craven known for his works of horror uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic but last night and robertas two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their fathers absence the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie robertas mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens predictably one of robertas students is gunned down and killed off screen one thing the film does lack is subtlety the fact that a little boy was playing we shall overcome on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience of course in horror films the foreshadowing and betweentheline moments are meant to be overdone so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game even with all its flaws music of the heart is a beautiful film that is not an excuse for the movies poor beginning but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history the performance included a deadon elvis impression robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies so how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santas favorite food this movie has an amazing finale 
seen april 16 1999 at 10 p m at crossgates cinema 18 guilderland n y theater 15 by myself for free using my hoyts critics pass theater rating 12 very good seats sound and picture do you realize that every time you encounter a new person youve just become part of a story everyone has their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several characters chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldnt usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them such as a teenage supermarket cashier a bottomofthedrugfoodchain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors these types of characters might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a midlevel drug dealer a narc obsessed with multilevelmarketing horny wedding guests a zen lovemaker two shrimpscarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out how they will all come together is the process the film deals with id imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the film starts out as anything else with little indication of whats to come we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesnt seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent shes not very charming especially to her customers but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works maybe this is because shes not a very afeminite character but shes far from masculine a creative character indeed things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences this agreement starts a threepronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nearly the same can be said for two other characters zack mohr and adam wolf who we dont think much of when they first appear as supporting characters but later will become major players to the films makeup another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene its clear this film isnt going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point its a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today and so the film begins to take shape first by following ronna and her friends on a onenight adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesnt exactly go as planned but thats what keeps it all so interesting the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronnas story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead simon and his three friends head to vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlaps with ronnas story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle were shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam arent even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were id really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who havent seen the film perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman its a great accomplishment he doesnt just depict a story he wraps us up in it all pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general its clear the script has been inspired by many sources with both obvious and subtle references yet it never screams ripoff tonemood where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre its not overlydark or twisted and the comedy isnt so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light cinematographyart direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture were able to get a sense of who they are what theyre thinking and how they came to be in their situations even when their actions are surprising it never seems very out of synch performances every actor nails their role see above themetheory the film doesnt seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages instead its more of a philosophical experiment in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure 42399 see also the big lebowski clerks jackie brown pulp fiction true romance also by liman swingers 
mars attacks 1996 c jack nicholson glenn close annette bening martin short danny devito rod steiger pierce brosnan sarah jessica parker michael j fox jim brown pam grier joe don baker natalie portman christina applegate lisa marie tom jones this is director tim burtons finest film to date many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day but even though the stories are similar they really are two distinctly different films however as a whole mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 and i loved id4 you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film it is completely wackedout and unlike anything youve ever seen once the silly tone of the film is set its easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just dont mix the plot is simple martians invade the earth but its different than any other invasion film usually its the evil aliens versus the heroic humans this time however its the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans the martians who are all computer generated are just about the funniest things ive seen in a long time they look funny they move funny and their language is hilarious and about the special effects the effects in mars attacks are just about the most flawless ones ive seen to date the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100 real there are just a couple of scenes that dont work mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship also glenn close overacts tremendously in her thankfully very limited screen time so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise but there are many big laughs in the film as i said if you are in the right mood could it have been funnier certainly was it funny enough yes was i entertained absolutely on a personal note id like to thank whomever cast rod steiger my favorite actor in the film as warcrazy general decker finally after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see while hes not given the type of role that you can give a real performance in he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him 
when i was asked to see this movie with a friend my initial reaction was not hugh grant i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker i just could not picture him in any romantic lead what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script this writer richard curtis whose exceptional first work four weddings and funeral shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy with splashes of drama thrown in between hugh and his hair is almost identical to the character that made him famous in four weddings he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck unfortunately he is type cast in this role but fortunately it works well for him in this movie if only he would dither a little less julia knows this role well the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love there are moments in this movie that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful but to have no one to share it with the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice 
youd think it would be easy to spoof star trek but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it thats a bit more difficult the farfetched scifi series is after all enormously popular what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies if youre not nice to it you lose galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brookss spaceballs was to star wars an affectionate riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems meanspirited or malintentioned the shows been cancelled but the journey is far from over that is the current tagline of galaxy quest a star trek type show thats no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns it also lives on in conventions gatherings of the shows obsessive fans who never fail to dress in galaxy quest costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble jason nesmith tim allen played commander peter quincy taggart on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do the attitudes of the rest tommy webber daryl mitchell gwen demarco sigourney weaver fred kwan tony shalhoub and alexander dane alan rickman range from indifference to utter contempt dane who played a spocklike alien is especially disgusted considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his characters cheesy trademark line by grabthars hammer you shall be avenged or something like that for his diehard fans one day nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of galaxy quest followers they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia they have mistaken the galaxy quest episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel the next day the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris named in one of the films only meanspirited gags after village voice film critic andrew sarris nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig and sort of blows it off but when he is transported or i should say shot back to earth in a rather celestial manner he believes next thing the cast knows they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship of course they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them but after some persuading they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians i was quite surprised how well this comedy which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign worked taking shots at both the obvious and notsoobvious elements of star trek and its fandom galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs opting instead for broad but smart parody nothing is safe not the cliches not the fans not the absurd taglines but on the other hand everything is safe since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoubs fred a k a tech sergeant chen who when in character is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek while scotty who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell i need more power down here captain chens cry for help is more to the tune of the core like wont take it or something its a hoot but it doesnt stop there weaver whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman with his relentlessly holierthanthou attitude arent far behind galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while its not a masterpiece it tends to falter in its more serious moments it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season by grabthars hammer this is a hell of a movie 
in my review of theres something about mary i said something to the effect of laughter isnt everything i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate laughter isnt everything unless im watching a jim abrahams film see spoofs are easy with me i love movies and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love sometimes im the only one in the theater laughing sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so highpitched in comparison to my speaking voice it cuts right through everyone elses laughter sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film abrahams latest film mafia induced this kind of hysteria upon me its gotten some mediocre reviews but hey im the guy who laughs at everything there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film but there are far more that work and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thoughtprovoking most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things like develop characters shape stories and other such nonsense mafia has no pretentions about characters or story and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh the film begins on the perfect high note with a mockery of the opening of casino our hero jay mohr is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire to describe the story of mafia is absurd and pointless but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films with a lot of casino references inserted throughout along the way the parodies seem arbitrary and rarely victimize mob films pictures like the english patient forrest gump and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing movies like this rely on just a few things but the most important element is direction abrahams has been down this path many times before hot shots top secret airplane and any other film with an exclamation point in the title and so i hold most of the success of mafia to his experience he takes just the right attitude in each scene and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic but it never develops the actors are all energetic which helps a lot with the tone of the film mohr suicide kings paulie who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors is so good here he looks like hes having so much fun that hes containing his laughter in every scene watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool hes probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brandos godfather while pamela gidley is deadon in a fullblown mockery of sharon stone the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that im supposed to give examples of things and be specific unfortunately i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia that i cant remember a lot of what made me laugh but thats a good sign mafia is so funny that i wasnt even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain i know that doesnt sound particularly complimentary but when watching a dumb comedy like this the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain finally a film that does this for me 
showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curryspiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyones taste but certainly a wellcrafted movie possibly that movies greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need to film it there was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all onscreen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent whos trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven whos not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and were left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movies but its far better than wed been led to expect by all the negative prerelease publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 and in the last quartercentury has pushed farther and farther experimenting with the sociallyacceptable limits to moviemaking his most recent three movies robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of backdoor access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives and now hes exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the directors contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewers have taken the politicallycorrect stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies its about people in an environment where naked ladies are common and why such an environment should exist its about the scum who use other people as powertrip toys and the need to escape their power its about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values dont pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment an nc17 movie which isnt sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything its a rape scene with a victim whos been duped into cooperation you dont make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors you dont make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed and you dont make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls and in an awful lot of vegas shows an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity showgirls deglamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness nomi is played in a very good performance by elizabeth berkley who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents whos at the end of her rope desperate to live a life better than the one shes known she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be when nomi realizes shes gone too far for too little she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be gina rivera plays molly a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomis entire life molly is the one who makes the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system shell be using for the rest of her life and nomis feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomis decision gina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer a reflexively competitive manipulator whos become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch a fading talent made bitter by selfawareness her character is very well drawn and performed in a major scene in a hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe molly is an honest hardworking person who means well and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is a talented dancer whos compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a cooperating part of the system exchanging selfrespect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nomi believes she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesnt need las vegas or its brand of stardom the male parts in this movie are simply props they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs camouflaged as a nice guy glenn plummer plays a dancer whos working as a bellboy and provides a bit of alternate perspective plummers character is the only one in the movie whos maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art but even hes succumbed to the cult of manipulation plummers character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacanos cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomis character alteration a nodialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc17 due to language sexual situations full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming as well i dont see a way this particular story could have been told well without it and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in moviemaking but dont go see it if youre not in a tough mood the only person its possible to like in this movie ends up in an i c u on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie youd enjoy meeting in person 
it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festivals palme dor a 100 millionplus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as a codirector of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampirefest from dusk till dawn in between he has moonlighted as an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonards novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie the story which starts out slowly develops into a twisty affair with doublecrosses and triplecrosses and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70s pop tunes and closeups of womens bare feet yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown the sheer inyourface exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostlystraightforward chronology of jackie brown doesnt match up favorably to the nonlinear style of tarantinos previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives and there arent nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around theres a samuel l jackson monologue about guns a jacksonchris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk and a jacksonrobert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jacksontravolta material from pulp fiction but thats about it jackie browns lone innovation is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives this isnt exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawas rashomon and most recently in edward zwicks courage under fire however while in those two movies and others there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple pointsof view tarantinos sole purpose for using it appears to be because its unconventional had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost as a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a 70s icon this time around instead of john travolta its blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown in one of many nods to the most famous segment of griers career tarantino uses a 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any buttkicking grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states shes working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tvs banyon to post the necessary 10 000 then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal jackie passes ordells test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle 500 000 of ordells money into the united states without tipping off the feds soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordells perpetually oversexed and druggedout girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his righthand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isnt nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their toughguyswhorarely smile roles bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantinos foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middleaged actor the film which clocks in at several minutes over the twoanda half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself when it comes to recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is a secondtier effort its an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender 
one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is sure its been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on overused but always fun one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is but how it goes around giving its story this rule applies highly to kiss the girls there is something psychologically stimulating in a wellcrafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls is certainly well made however the whole film screams of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through well not only are the actors capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers one that seven a film a lot like this one knew not to make was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind i was waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film plotwise kiss the girls shows almost no originality we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman a forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two and as a result we cant sympathize with detective cross however what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is a smart athletic woman and because of these traits becomes a target for casanovawhat the serial killer likes to call himself because of these characterdeveloping scenes we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods remembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides to break one of them by calling out when casanova comes to punish her she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall after she is found she begins to help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive many people will compare this film to 1995s seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but i presume that the similarities are intentional the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet i dont quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us sometimes a simple shot is the best one however many of the shots are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing makes this scene work so well the chaotic and mtvtype cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judds character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors morgan freeman is one of todays most powerful and believable actors detective cross is a very good character for him although it is just a similar one to the character in seven because of freemans powerful presence he carries half the film by himself the other half is carried by ashley judd one of todays most promising dramatic actresses in fact her performance is better than freemans if that is even possible her character is more original than freemans and she handles it wonderfully we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast members do as much as they can with it cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for a character tony goldwyn fairs slightly better but we dont really get to know his character either gina ravera gives a good performance but again she isnt in many of the scenes so as a result of all these small supporting parts the weight of the film lies on the two leads and they do a phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspects of the film are quite good director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also doesnt handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have losing a lot of tension during many scenes however to his credit he does manage a terrific first half part of the blame falls on david klass im sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more but klass focuses on the two main parts while this may give the two leads more screentime many of the small characters are onedimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent none of the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer i blame this mainly on the casting director because the killers motive is because of rejection from women or so i assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friends is a shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girls is rated r for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibilities of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain in fact i had the urge to see it again just for the performances the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through morgan freeman is possibly todays most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt i must also say that i loved the ending the showdown between good and evil was quite tense and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isnt anyway 
i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars from my first viewing i noticed that david mamets film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning from my second viewing however i noticed that mamets script was actually a masterpiece the spanish prisoner like the usual suspects or chinatown begs for the viewers complete attention miss a scene or even a small detail and you could miss the meaning of the entire film also like the aforementioned films it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games like his past gem the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much or even more than the victim because we were deceived just like the victim we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over without giving a right answer is unique and ingenious the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued after seeing the film again i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening his direction is very subtle as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them or think you see all of them the story follows a young up and coming businessman joe ross campbell scott who has just created a mysterious and lucrative process that everyone is trying to get their hands on soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his process through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters the rich and popular jimmy dell a secretary who has a huge crush on ross and ross boss mr klein played by steve martin rebecca pidgeon and ben gazarra respectively the supporting cast is very solid especially martin who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role the most interesting character in the film though was campbell scotts joe ross the characters transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable david mamets script is so interesting because we know people dont actually talk like the characters in the film yet we feel so connected to some of them his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge this is a must see for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie 
an unhappy italian housewife a lonely waiter a goofy masseuse lots of love and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips which proves charming despite its covering of predictable wellworn material the story concerns the aforementioned housewife rosalba barletta licia maglietta who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation instead of waiting for a ride home rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town but to instead hitchhike to venice upon arriving she tells her selfcentered husband mimmo an excellent antonio catania that shell be home in a few days of course that doesnt happen as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries in what seems like days she moves in with lonely suicidal waiter fernando bruno ganz gets a job as a florist learns the accordion and befriends her neighbor a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia marina massironi rosalba who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando i can think of at least five other american movies including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman that are more than similar to bread and tulips but maglietta and ganz who act with restraint and care help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world throughout the movie maglietta has an easygoing confident demeanor which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganzs character the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up director and cowriter silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor the cheap mimmo desperate to find his wife after all he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wont do it hires a job applicant giuseppe battiston at his bathroom supply firm to do the job the reason mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories the novice detectives various misfortunes including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother are very funny unfortunately there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips cheery tone rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice which bring the movie to a halt its like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie several details in fernandos life also never get proper closure including his suicidal tendencies early in the movie he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door after that fernandos step towards death is never made reference to probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm underdeveloped subplot about fernandos stormy past it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesnt need any but there arent a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips the movie is fun and romantic with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives wed like to live if we had the nerve or if our passports werent missing 
after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction jackie brown seems like something of a lighthearted departure for quentin tarantino its more of a hohum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language luckily his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer the story introduces us to a streetwise black woman named jackie brown pam grier a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another she works for a bottomofthebarrel airline and receives a minimal salary but one day she is picked up by a pair of federal officials including michael keaton as the toughnosed ray nicolet and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell samuel l jackson who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle 500 000 through to them under nicolets nose with the help of ordells oaf of a partner robert de niro and druggedout lady friend bridget fonda also entering the picture is a bailbondsman named max cherry robert forster who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated how i wont say the big dropoff is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown in which numerous doublecrosses take place and many clothing store bags filled with cash switch hands its unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there and doesnt offer anything extremely compelling while doing so there are as always amusing exchanges between characters the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq or lack thereof the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie a 56year old white bail bondsman and a 44year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry youve got to commend the acting jackie brown is a seriously draggedout exercise enlivened by such fine acting the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours 35 minutes tarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline also fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear jackie brown has four major shootings and two of those take place mostly offscreen so dont be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath you can expect frequent foul language mostly coming way of ordell who much to the dismay of spike lee uses the n word as part of his regular vocabulary the acting is the glue that holds everything together grier making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970s is more than adequate for the title character in fact shes flatout great another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster who does a grand job as max cherry and is perfectly cast in doing so michael keaton makes his presence felt albeit in small but dignified moments and de niro is ideal in playing the lughead who goes over the edge speaking of that bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordells bikiniclad beach babe and yet she manages to look fairly occupied theres not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie which is a lifesaver for mr tarantino the story barely holds together in the meantime and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake but oh well jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work lets just hope that the director hasnt gone soft on us 
upon taking a seat at the theater and surveying the crowd i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises im twentytwo but have been accused of looking sixteen yet as the film began any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five closeknit yet troubled sisters director pat oconnor inventing the abbots circle of friends weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss need and the bonds between five sisters the family is ruled by kate meryl streep an unconsciously strict schoolteacher who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family there is very little background given to the viewer as we are thrust into a tense but loving home squabbles take place one after the other caused by years and years of history perhaps one of the best things about this film is its naturalness no situation is overwrought and characters react as real people do to real problems this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples both in lughnasa and africa in fact dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness legs tap and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster only after the music stops and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble in the quiet after the music we muse that its sad that music has to cease and families falter the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy the narrator of the movie as a young child flying a kite he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string and the kite floats off farther into the distance drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained and at another glance mischievous the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite and kates hold of the family isnt strong enough to hold off the winds of change as michael stands staring at his kite fly away we hear the adult michael looking back at the season that his world changed forever the movie is not overpowering but it gives us a beautiful window into the life love and trouble of a household of lonely women note this is the first movie review ive ever written any responses on it would be greatly appreciated 
in may of 1977 just 2 years after steven spielbergs success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas the godfather a risky ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film in january of this year lucas rereleased star wars on its 20th anniversary in this new remastered version the added effects which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computergenerated jabba the hutt dont do much but call attention to themselves other than these the film is exactly the same why pay to see it in the theaters you might ask simply because when this movie was released most of us were a few years short of being born we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience especially if you havent seen it the plot is basic but in the same way complex it has many themes but the one rotates around luke skywalker mark hamill and his quest to become a jedi knight his mission begins when a droid named r2d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia carrie fisher which tells him to contact the mysterious obiwan kanoby alec guiness he and kanoby then joined by two intergalactic renegades hans solo harrison ford and chewbacca and skywalkers two droids d2 and c3po the voice of anthony edwards wage war upon the corrupt empire commanded by an evil general peter cushing and the traitorous darth vader the voice of james earl jones skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger the force the film is obviously quite starstudded but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones voice would appear so many more times in the future it just happened to work out for him the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalkers triumph is symbolized by the audiences sense of becoming something larger than life itselfa universe of fans young and old recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever 
strange days chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles as the locals gear up for the new millenium lenny nero ralph fiennes goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips he pines for his exgirlfriend faith juliette lewis not noticing that another friend mace angela bassett really cares for him this film features good performances impressive filmmaking technique and breathtaking crowd scenes director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it but as a whole this is an unsatisfying movie the problem is that the writers james cameron and jay cocks were too ambitious aiming for a film with social relevance thrills and drama not that ambitious filmmaking should be discouraged just that when it fails to achieve its goals it fails badly and obviously the film just ends up preachy unexciting and uninvolving 
theres a thin line between satire and controversy and mike nichols the birdcage wolf has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election based on the book written by anonymous actually former newsweek writer joe klein john travolta plays governor jack stanton but he doesnt actually play stanton he plays bill clinton just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville although the credits will of course say otherwise the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton adrian lester a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations and whether it be keeping the history of his boss pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers richard jemmons billy bob thorton and daisy green maura tierney team up with henry as the wouldbe presidents advisors and hire lesbian veteran libby holden kathy bates as the campaigns eccentric tougher than dirt incriminator together they face all sorts of sexual allegations the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race in its satire and controversy primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nittygritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out its characters letting us understand what they want and why and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look and the rest of the cast also make superb performances adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden at occasions you cant help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste there are long slabs of time where john travolta unquestionably the most interesting to watch is missed from the screen and since it is awkwardly structured as henrys story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot or even the point of the film having said that make no mistake primary colors is always enjoyable to watch but frequently we have to ask ourselves exactly what are we watching most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary and almost unsuitable to the rest of the film but as i mentioned before there is a thin line between satire and controversy and for the most part primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a farfromoverpowering look at winning the publics opinion although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is thankfully it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really its scary 
it was only a matter of time before a dilbertesque office comedy hit the screens however rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams office space is instead based on the work of another animator mike judge creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill in his liveaction directoral debut judge aptly spoofs corporate culture the story is certainly not very involved but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps peter ron livingston is a programmer working at the initech corporation every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before in other words every day is the worst day in his entire life hes stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors all obsessed with administrative trivialities hes smitten with joanna jennifer aniston a local waitress but hasnt the guts to even introduce himself everything has simply made him a complete nervous wreck but all of that changes when after an unintentionally overeffective visit to a hypnotherapist peter loses all of his inhibitions he realizes his lifelong dream to do absolutely nothing he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss bill lumbergh gary cole doing whatever he feels like peters friends and coworkers samir ajay naidu and michael bolton david herman no not that michael bolton are perplexed by their friends sudden change in attitude but they have larger things to worry about rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing as bleak as much of this sounds let me assure you that office space is a comedy and quite a funny one although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life each mundane detail taken by itself seems completely regrettably plausible yet when combined into a whole the picture which results is absolutely surreal ron livingston tackles his role straightfaced and becomes much funnier because of it his character isnt simply being a clown lampooning around the office but rather seems possessed by a zenlike clarity he is operating on a higher plane where everything suddenly makes sense and from this vantage point he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film in fact in addition to being wildly humorous the film may actually prove to be cathartic the animated roots of office space show in the films lack of complexity most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk one employee milton stephen root is practically a fleshandblood cartoon however despite their simple nature the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny its not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film though the situations may seem exceedingly farfetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are the film is flimsy and absurd but also very funny 
all those who were offended by theres something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch and while this uproariously funny grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenagetargeted fare this season i must question the studio that releases a movie like this the producers are aiming these films at the 1524 crowd but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an rrated film some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc17 a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie american pie was threatened with an nc17 but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product it was given an r but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park it is sick perverse and ultimately disgusting not to mention extremely funny american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night jim jason biggs kevin thomas ian nicholas oz chris klein and finch eddie kaye thomas are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base to which one of his friends replies like warm apple pie of course this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner there are many moments such as this in which director paul weitz uses a gameplan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief american pie is a hardfought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it i loved the young cast in this movie consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects and you should appreciate their performances biggs is more than enjoyable and chris klein who recently played a similar jock in election is obviously a young talent on the rise but in a teendominated movie the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy of televisions sctv who is unexpectedly brilliant as jims uneasy father scenes in which the familiar fatherson conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie after levy discovers jims new use for apple pie he tells him i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age but i never used baked goods it is performances such as his and bill murrays in rushmore that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out there are some lessthanoriginal aspects of the film a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of exlax is something weve seen before if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers then this is a decidedly unwise move the same prank was pulled in the brothers dumb and dumber and used to greater effect secondly the characters are forced into a halfhearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing but at one point in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of its own biggs asks his buddies why hes going through so much pressure for something thats not very important anyway and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate it still manages to be mature in its own way 
albert brooks saves the day just in the nick of time with a very poor summer for movies brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up and does so in a positive way while this may not be his finest work the muse still shakes up some delightful humor in albert brooks latest comedy he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter brooks whos losing his edge as his business partners say in desperation he goes to see his friend jack jeff bridges who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past he asks jack for some help and recieves word of a real life muse that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career so brooks seeks the muse named sarah sharon stone and is suckered into buying her expensive food etc as a sort of payment the real punch line however doesnt come until the end it really makes you wonder how screenwriters really get their ideas could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner speaking of brooks he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter every time he graces the screen i cant help but start laughing albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone she wasnt likeable at all brooks had the right idea with her occupation but she never pulled through in a way she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak luckily brooks could clean up the mess and cover for stones mishap it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance because the muse had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy on a brighter note andie macdowell was also charming as brooks wife she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film shes in the funniest moments in the muse in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese i mean imagine brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice like it was something out of the ordinary it was just plain hilarious it just adds to the satire joke of how directors get ideas brilliant move by brooks as i mentioned before the film is a satire much like its proceeder bowfinger which came out a few weeks before unlike bowfinger this is not a mean spirited film thats desperate for jokes its rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood bowfinger had its moments but had quite a few problems that were never worked out but the muse still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour by the end of the film youre glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it for once im not fully disappointed because the film didnt slow down it kept moving even with some flaws thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort i think hell still manage to keep his edge around well into the future

razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th 1998 official release halloween reviewed by vince yim you think you know all about vampires believe me you know f ck all with these words we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver played by eileen daly made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being so whats an undead girl to do except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible get out her guns seduce a few guys and kill a few people for money and blood with that out of the way let me say this this film is bad this film is really really bad yet somehow it is strangely enjoyable with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick buxom babes gore cheesy dialogue and bad acting any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade still it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film agreed it might be but is far from being the best vampire flick ever period razor blade smile has some rather high production values shown by the nice overall tone to the film the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating doesnt sleep in a coffin but leaves one next to her computer and sees religion as the opium of the peoples hence immunity to crosses but aside from that it doesnt stray too far away from horror film conventions that is unless that is intentional razor blade smile literally goes for the throat then pumps the wound full of processed cheese you cant help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle youll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations to distract two female guards lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number youll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably and then theres the sudden twist ending i have enough heart not to give it away the film refuses to take itself seriously which is a good thing as by the time lilith zips up her skintight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage youve most likely forgotten the main point of the story but in case you really care shes been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the socalled illuminati and shes leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find as much as my criticisms this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups almost destined for cultstatus the films campy cheesy overtones actually work towards the film while this may not necessarily be the film youd want to be seen watching by yourself it makes for a fun time at the movies 
pitch black is a sheep in wolfs clothing it is full of darkness danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype an unsettling and scary film going experience dont be fooled pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scarefest it starts off with blistering intensity a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns among the survivors is fry mitchell the ships pilot who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely there is imam david an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film there is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns hauser who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal and there is riddick diesel a menacing musclebound convicted murderer whos being brought back to justice by johns the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other confident in their assessment of matters a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment those plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planets wildlife a predatory sometimes winged species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh fortunately the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planets surface unfortunately the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur taking away their one protection from the monsters the groups savior comes in the form of johns whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory or does it pitch black deviates from the standard scifi fare by avoiding some of the stock escape the boogieman conflicts the genre typically serves up just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith whether it be religious or in a person and how that powers their motivations i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist conversely imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah one by one his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed imam is forced to reassess his faith another character expresses belief in god along with a life long hate yet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting repercussions for several of group it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick special mention should be made of vin diesel who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick they can be excused for the two or three shwarzeneggerlike catch phrases that growl their way out of diesels mouth the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked the creatures do look derivative of the ones in alien the dialogue isnt the freshest at times reminiscent of a bad comic book yes the appearance of riddicks vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives 
seen february 15 1998 on home video borrowed from chris wessell when it comes to modern gangster movies its really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre andor just using the word routine ive always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea no matter how many times its been used before can provide for a good story and donnie brasco clinches this idea its not unlike most of the great films of the genre yet it never apes anothers style as it has a good layer of authenticity even if its core is a tad stale the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it we meet lefty pacino an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this somehow he comes across donnie brasco depp a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isnt afraid of lefty and his rep and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him its clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately telling him all the tricks of the trade i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit however we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone an fbi agent working undercover a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor a brief history of the mob definitions of their slang and where their money comes from and who it goes to the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements however the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works probably from watching other gangster movies and although this attitude comes across the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable thankfully the film doesnt become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime and instead opts for character development much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would hes old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be we learn of his accomplishments which are quite impressive within their context and when he complains about not being made top boss its easy to sympathize with him newell constantly plays up this aspect making it a major theme which works well in the long run as donnie is constantly impressing and even oneupping lefty its hard to tell which emotion is more powerful the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed most of the film tells the story of donnies life in mafia which creates for many subplots and individual conflicts but doesnt always seem to come together as a whole the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar the resonance to donnies actual assignment varies he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress but it doesnt always seem to have much meaning back home his wife maggie heche is ready to divorce him because hes never a and the family is suffering since this is based on a true story i wouldnt doubt this would happen although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act or at least any real sense of closure a climax of sorts does occur but theres little feeling of a payoff we get a happy ending which is good but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful aside from a few minor general flaws donnie brasco manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development it may be routine but its good and thats respectful 
 sometimes the green mile seems sooooo long indeed and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review on a more positive note let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length the mile in question green due to its faded limecolored linoleum leads from the prison cell to old sparky the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisianas cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 paul edgecomb tom hanks youve got mail is the head guard of eblock otherwise known as death row keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they talk to the convicts instead of yelling at them this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars into his charge comes one john coffey michael clarke duncan armageddon a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls immediately paul senses something different about this prisoner perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he takes back pauls bladder infection thereby restoring him to health based on steven kings 1996 serialized novel the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told eduard delacroix michael jeter patch adams is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks percy wetmore doug hutchison a time to kill is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner fry up close and hal moores james cromwell babe pig in the city is the compassionate warden for whom despite all the executions hes witnessed death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor while it is mr hanks everyman performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting all involved do credible work in their respective roles most especially mr duncan who turns in an impressive fully realized characterization if only the story were more credible writerdirector frank darabont the shawshank redemption has crafted a flawed fantasyallegory of sorts one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power mr darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts presence on eblock the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched much has also been made of coffeys christlike ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures coffeys powers are shrouded in mystery taking on the feel of a circus trick coupled with a voodoolike i feel your pain transference in contrast there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god the genuine gifts of healing listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god true spiritual healing with few exceptions requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism but from the revealed word of god 
i guess there are those who have never been kissed before a rare and dying breed except if youre child in which case it would be called experimenting rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties hardest to believe still is that drew barrymore has never been kissed despite all these hard to believe tit bits there are people out there who have never truly been kissed and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling reassuring them that their search for true love is over well this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life and its sweet drew barrymore who shone in ever after is wonderful as josie grossy the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter it addresses the issues of how a dweeb becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting hard to believe but possible there may also be those who have been kissed before but in fact never truly been given the kiss so this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it either way it is one enjoyable sit with a fairytale ending 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts excerpt from as you like it act ii scene 7 when william shakespeare penned this passage he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash this is the world of today and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical highconcept project like the truman show truman burbank jim carrey seems to have the perfect life he has a pretty doting wife meryl laura linney a comfortable insurance sales position an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven a reliable childhood buddy marlon noah emmerich except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia this is paradise or so it would seem bizarre inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in trumans life a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term isolated follows him around a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move for the first time in his life it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be the truman show directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol is a remarkably wellconstructed film paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next balancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy in many ways mr niccols screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal characterdefining moments occurring at sea although the films rather conventional climax doesnt sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first twothirds and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film it remains foremost a finelycrafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and as the carefullystacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog vs the system formula while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some elements are lacking the device of mysterious laurensylvia natascha mcelhone as a contributing impetus to trumans growing awareness isnt exactly convincing theres not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside trumans artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright antivoyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city ive always believed that the versatile ms linney possesses a tremendous comic gift she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing a glazed insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans cheerfully going over the top its hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that shed have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ms linney is a delight in the film but it is mr carrey who rules the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal its difficult not to root for truman in a commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint theres an early scene where hes down on his knees gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gags its almost poetic how this notorious lookatme actor successfully tones it down to play a character whos constantly the centre of attention in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating trumans antiseptic white picketfenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitzs original score technical credits are firstrate all around while the truman show is clearly a definitive highconcept film its not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound ranging from 1965s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner all the same this is a visionary awardcalibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the films concept seems unfathomably outrageous its abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such a scenario perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world 
in chocolat a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures patterns and lines hoping shell be able to foresee the kind of chocolate theyll most enjoy some scoff the idea but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole on the surface it appears to be a light fluffy fable with no depth or true worth but when one takes a second deeper look chocolats true colors begin to shine through making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it lasse hallstroms chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously craftednot to mention one of the best films of the year what gives chocolat its magic much like hallstroms 1999 winner of two academy awards the cider house rules is its willingness to say whats on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrowmindedness chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rules and the majority lives by only one law religion the bulk of the townspeople with few exceptions are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly nonreligious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouthwatering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by viannes opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud a cartoonlike alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business on the other hand the shop is a delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in viannes shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parentkoening which comes as a result of his mother carrieann moss believing armande is a bad influence as she does not hold the same strict religious beliefs that she does also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offers a home and befriends juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne genuinely capturing her characters determination to turn the narrowminded townspeople into more happy independent human beings but most of chocolats success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses lena olin previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of a lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs judi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin carrie annmoss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk a young girl hoping her alwaysonthemove mother will eventually settle down a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary women one extraordinary movie thats not to say the men dont do their share though alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh oconor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portmans masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules chocolat adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel is a wonderful little treat of a film one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter while not as powerful as the cider house rules lasse hallstroms chocolat is a film which works on all levelsas a drama a comedy a fable a romance and a fairy tale and it even lives up to its name it is delicious to savor the taste of easy to digest and like all excellent chocolate it is memorable for days afterward the bottom line chocolat is pure pleasure

assume nothing the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990s as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be the phrase especially goes for oscar novak an architect who is the main focus of three to tango a delightful funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself novak matthew perry a shy clumsy chicago based architect along with openly gay partner peter steinberg oliver platt fights for projects day in and day out one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman dylan mcdermott a rich wellknown businessman charles immediately takes a liking to oscar as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor seeing oscar as someone he could trust charles asks him to watch his girlfriend an unpredictable adventurous girl named amy post neve campbell who makes a living by blowing glass charles wants to know who she talks to what she does and where she goes the point to make sure shes not seeing someone else of course oscar gladly takes the job and meets amy at an art show of hers and sparks fly between the two from the get go oscar feels he has found the one meant for him and he is content with the idea of being with amy well another popular phrase of the 90s is all good things must come to an end and this stays true for oscar as well charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night as oscar and amy have become great friends but he doesnt seem to mind why is this he thinks oscar is gay hes not afraid to share this with him either oscar stands in shock after the words i swear if you werent gay oscar id have to kill you are muttered flamboyantly from charles mouth the word spreads instantly through town will oscar come out of his supposed gayness or will he tell everyone that he isnt one would immediately think he would deny the fact but numerous occurrences come to oscar which result in the fact that if he denies the fact he could lose his job with charles matthew perry doesnt escape his character as chandler on the already classic t v comedy friends as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless shy and sensitive nonetheless perry is hilarious here and shows that he can handle drama as obviously his character suffers quite a bit here its wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie she was the star of scream 1 and 2 and the upcoming scream 3 as she handles comedy superbly here her voice smile and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies stay with this genre neve neve is delightful as her conflicted character who feels love for oscar but knows based on rumors that he is gay as usual campbell is likable as her likable character unlike the other two leads here dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue and is never convincing when his character his present mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting stick to the t v drama the practice dylan the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano no originality or technique is used whatsoever three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy or else the film would have been a disaster as it is just plain boring to look at three to tango is a film done many times before as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998s the object of my affection but the plot has never been completed so well three to tangos script written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun fast and funny delivering not only original hilarious gay jokes not your run of the mill material but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling unlike last summers south park bigger longer and uncut and 1997s in out three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar the script is wise to take this route as gays cant i dont think so anyway be offended by this light playful comedy to prove this a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly three to tangos climax is a hilarious clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romanticmistaken identity comedies three to tango is a gem the bottom line three to tango is a light sharp snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending and great stars one of the better romantic comedies of 1999 
the question isnt why has grease been reissued the answer to that one is easy to celebrate the movies 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramounts coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity no the question that ought to be asked is should grease be reissued the answer is not an easy one grease is a fun movie an entertaining fantasy of the 50s embodying all the cliches of that era the music is lively and the dance numbers choreographed by patricia birch are energetic and highspirited travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon cool but nonthreatening but grease didnt break any new cinematic ground it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider what grease is or has become is the highestgrossing musical in film history ok lets not be a spoilsport grease is a fun and entertaining movie even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta olivia newtonjohn taxis jeff conaway and the multitalented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers its nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was and its sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly cinematically the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur between grease and 1996s evita you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated no make that cynical and jaded today if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight he or she would probably be hooted off the screen todays audiences lack the innocence that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed secondly a lack of talent performers with the charisma the style the largerthanlife panache of fred astaire gene kelly ginger rogers and judy garland are gone most singers and dancers remain on the stage and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts a good example is gregory hines one of the greatest dancers in the world he danced a bit in the cotton club tap and white nights but those were essentially dramatic vehicles so perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose if audiences show enough interest meaning if the rerelease earns the studio enough revenue it may spark a revival in movie musicals perhaps not original musicals such as singin in the rain an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years at one time or another according to the industry rumor mill hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webbers cats a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago the latter reportedly to star madonna so let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals let grease be the word that sparks this revival 
lets face it since waterworld floated by the summer movie season has grown very stale with no new eyecandy for four weeks straight weve had to sustain ourselves on the quasinutritional value of cheatin husbands traveling chocolate salesmen and computer generated serial killers sigh thank god for desperado the freewheeling sequel to el mariachidirector robert rodriguezs notorious 7000 debutstars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name hes a man in black with revenge on his mind and an arsenal in his case the woman he loved was killed in the first film so he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers sort of a texmex version of the punisher if you will there isnt much of an emotional core to desperado rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo and sergio leone and sam peckinpah some may wince at the body countat least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimatebut its all played for laughs big broad hispanic laughs that for me recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films sick slick fun 
if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie from dusk till dawn would probably be it scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez desperado the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence and is incredibly fun to watch it starts off as a pulp fictiontype crime story with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store because this is a tarantino movie however its not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot its a case of a hole being shot through someones hand a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie everything overdone and nothing as it seems clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it harvey keitel plays the backslidden expreacher and juliette lewis his daughter whom registered sexpervert tarantino eyes endlessly you know youre mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive although shes not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border clooneys strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet it does its trick the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind never noticing clooney or tarantino once they get to mexico its time to wait at the rendezvous point a topless bar called titty twister where were once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper finally after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him the stripper turns into a vampire soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back thats right weve come all this way to see a vampire movie but like everything else tarantino takes this ageold genre and twists it to his own ends to produce overthetop entertainment so we get holy water condom balloons heads rolling quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes a lap dog of satan the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100 tarantino hovering between absurd and disgusting as when theyre entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister but always entertaining and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more secondrate gorefest clooney keitel and especially tarantino are so overthetop with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people even if theres absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment from dusk till dawn isnt the classic of modern cinema that pf is but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie 
the smallscale film in limited release waking ned devine is a pleasant excursion to a time and place which allows the audience to absorb the full texture of a small town filled with breathtaking scenery characters and delightful music the movie would be interesting even without a plot the story contains several surprises which are best left unmentioned in a review the film starts out with a sharp opening which gives us a taste of what is to follow country folk with an inclination for a bit of larceny what gets things going is the fact that a winner of the lottery is apparently one of the residents in the small town pop 52 of tullymore who that person is and how to share in the good fortune is the mission of two longtime friends jackie ian bannen and michael david kelly part detectives part scalawags they have to stay alert to the changing circumstances they face as the story unfolds the village consists of several amusing characters a clueless pig farmer temporary priest and a witch theres also the lotto man who must be satisfied that everything is on the upandup there are no hollywood touches to this film except for the outer space introduction pacing is right towards the end it runs a bit out of steam but thats okay because for most of the 90 minutes weve been interested in the goings on a mixture of laughs and occasional sentiment all the right emotions are engaged in one brief dream sequence youll know it when you see it a fantastic combination of color and music transports the characters to a place you really hope exists one of the key moments in the film the music available on cd london 289 460 9392 follows the same arc as the movie and is well worth considering a fine film thats for everybody except action fans somewhat like the englishman who went up a hill and came down a mountain but livelier 
warren beattys bulworth is a caustic political comedy that doesnt attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system some might think this film is vulgar and in many ways it is however as loud and raucous as it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear beatty who directed the film and cowrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sisters stars as incumbent u s senator jay billington bulworth who has one of the best politician names in cinema history bulworth is a democrat and in beattys view he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden which was once the calling card of democrats bulworth has become another sellout money hound if hes not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese hes making windbag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium blah blah blah when the film opens it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become in a fit of desperation he takes out a 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee and then hires a hit man to kill him although he doesnt know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general at a compton church he tells the group of africanamericans that they will have no power in the u s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife later in a particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason hes there is because my guys always put the big jews on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworths chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment platt has some of the movies funniest scenes as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant halftruthtelling and spindoctoring to cover bulworths stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a selfrighteous reporter nora dunn who acts like murphys refusal to explain bulworths actions something he really cannot do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he wants to live after all and therefore must constantly evade a grimlooking assassin to be whos trailing him at every turn he hides out in the ghetto complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews at this point beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black innercity experience bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina halle berry who he meets at the harlem church rally she has a toughtalking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l d don cheadle of boogie nights who also becomes involved in bulworths campaign some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense innercity films like boyznhood 1991 and menace ii society 1993 bulworths chief liability is beattys insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device instead of speaking at political rallies he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hiphop stars are black its hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether hes actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sounds more run d m c than snoop doggy dogg which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the innercity lingo and working that into his speeches instead of trying to sound like l l cool j other than that bulworth hits all its targets with wry hilarious accuracy the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you dont agree with beattys liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary colors which opened earlier this year bulworth doesnt try to tiptoe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home instead it takes them deadon 
when i saw the trailer for this film i laughed harder than i had in quite some time while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good im happy to say that theres something about mary is not one of those trailer letdowns in fact watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours the film opens up in flashback to 1985 at a high school in cumberland rhode island ted stroehmann ben stiller is a social reject who cant seem to get a date to the upcoming prom until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren w earl brown whos being harassed by one of the school jocks it seems warrens sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with teds willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite a very real chance of getting beaten up mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom ted was just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital fast forward to the present where ted has cleaned himself up now writes for a magazine but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years mary whom he hasnt seen since that fateful day with the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love however when pat finds mary he falls for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affections theres something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedies they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or coworkers to think you had such a great time watching them with their current film the farrelly brothers have come up with something youll not only enjoy but also wont mind talking about the next day at the water cooler the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles from the subtle to the ridiculous and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films they almost all work i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on one minute youll be laughing at something ted says and the next youll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of marys apartment one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because hes a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation teds a nice fellow and tries to do his best but for some reason or another things just dont always work out its comical but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top actually ive liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mideighties the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruisepaul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become a bigtime bowling hustler it was parody at its finest more of which showed up in the shortlived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late 92early 93 like the critic which aired on abc then fox i still mourn that shows cancellation cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paperthin at times however diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why shes got guys just falling over each other to be with her heck i even found her laugh to be cute even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesnt change and you know its really true he and ralph macchio must hang out or something maybe they live in dick clarks pool house anyway heres another good piece of casting as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into marys heart the supporting performances are also good chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy lin shae who plays marys neighbor magda and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin provides some good laughs especially in scenes with her benjilike dog which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film lee evans as marys friend tucker displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there arent any noticeable times where the film drags the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plotrelevant information right toward the camera its a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film after that it got a little annoying and its unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow fortunately filled with sight gags humorous lines and solid comedic acting theres something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater 
plot a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side but this new guy is not like all the others hes got ambition hes got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster violence lots of swearing and betrayals ensue critique a very good seriousminded unique british gangster flick which misses the great mark by way of an annoying voiceover popping up throughout the film and a soso ending heres yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix okay so its not entirely new but its definitely original when all put together as done here the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place its 1968 and these dudes are looking good yes its all about the suits fellas the italian shoes the cufflinks the ties and the birds thats ladies for those uninitiated hanging around you here are a bunch of horrible men gangsters if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting heads all over the place but thats not the basis of this movie the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his cronies paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affects the other you know how there are always these hangeron gangster types who latch on to the godfathers the leaders the top dogs of every crime organization well most of the time these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that is their boss so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence but this film brings the betrayals the messed up loyalties the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package of course director paul mcguigan isnt trying to be guy ritchie here and doesnt overstylize his presentation jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix nope he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which hes attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty look into my eyes in fact the last time that ive seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers millers crossing scary shite but theres an ever better scene than that in this film this one features bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster from that mans pointofview but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one thats right he does the guy in his underwear that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman but the flicks not perfect in fact i didnt mind malcolm mcdowells voiceover narration at first but as the film grew into a major flashback most of the film is presented as such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot all he seemed to do was swear and call people the cword umpteen times and even described one scene as it was happening so i opened the door then went up the lift etc its like yeah i know that already i could see it on the screen overdone i also didnt quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed a little unbelievable especially when you consider that its supposed to be taking place 30 years later and folks still seem to be holding grudges still in love still living in the same apartments i mean cmon its 30 years man i dont know somehow it didnt work all that well for me but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies and this one is a decent addition to the lot forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowells narration of the obvious plot points and concentrate on the films stronger attributes such as its style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads bettany and thewlis incidentally unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films its the real deal note this film is packed with strong accents all around which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time its also quite violent and i dont remember any film that used the cword as much as this one so leave the kids at home for this one wheres joblo coming from american psycho 1010 a clockwork orange 910 donnie brasco 810 fight club 1010 get carter 710

bruce lee was a biggerthanlife martial artist and actor bruces unique character i e selfproduced sound effects etc and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor james lee the story is told from his wife lindas point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lees life however you cant help but like whenever the fight scenes are on what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character i also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lees life before he became famous scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english it seemed as if he was no better than anybody else scenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the allwhite students cheerleaders and athletes it seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes in conclusion the movie was well made it produced a realization of who bruce lee was and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor and the fighting scenes were all excellent so go see it and enjoy the movie p s if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven 
clint eastwood in his ripe old age is cashing one talent in for another midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwooddirected film clint isnt even in and its damn good adapted from a bestselling john berendt novel based on true events this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head and thats just the mayor as director and producer eastwood contributes a self indulgent but very competent 150 minutes neatly balancing drama suspense and humor like all great movies midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves and not from some contrived juvenile intrusion the acting from bigtime stars john cusack and kevin spacey is as good as youd expect but its the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm cusack plays a freelance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spaceys parties lots of food beverages and gunplay yes an employee of spaceys has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead it seems like a simple matter of self defense the guy threatened spacey shot at him missed then spacey took him out but being a movie theres much more to it than that and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in the weird circle of entertainment this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in theres the requisite sexy woman alison nepotists daughter eastwood the strange piano player the voodoo woman and the transvestite miss chablis deserves a paragraph of hisher own as the stealer of every scene she appears in what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony chablis playing herself is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul but never seems exploited as the movies comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating certainly the characterizations of the judge and spaceys lawyer both help immensely as does having the flyguy as the jurys foreman its here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spaceys homosexuality yes spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man before he shot him of course midnight in the garden of good and evil isnt a classic but it is one of the better celebritydirected truestory bestseller adaptations out there likewise no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations but the performances are all great in fact id almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category serving america for more than 125th of a century 
meet joe black is your classic boymeetsgirl boylikesgirl boygetskilledinhorribleaccident supernaturalentitytakesoverboysbody supernaturalentityfallsinlovewithgirl story based on the 1934 film death takes a holiday meet joe black is a well acted romantic drama which explores the meanings of life and love william parrish anthony hopkins is a billionaire businessman on the brink of his 65th birthday he has built a huge media empire and raised two beautiful daughters allison marcia gay harden and susan claire forlani william has been able to negotiate his way out of many tough spots but he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality the one situation he wont be able to talk his way out of and he has good reason to fear for death himself is stalking him however death has a deal to make death has taken possession of a man who has recently died brad pitt and wants william to be his guide in a holiday among the living in return william gets to live a few extra days of course he agrees death under the human name of joe black gets to experience life as a complete innocent he never before has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter and hes not quite compared for the more complex pleasures when he and susan fall in love but is their affair doomed to an early demise at nearly three hours in length meet joe black is a little bit on the leisurely side though it never gets boringly lengthy instead the film gets a chance to develop some nicely textured characters and situations you get to soak in and enjoy the atmosphere rather than being hurriedly rushed through it the romantic angle works well though surprisingly the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter this is most likely due to anthony hopkins who once again displays his superb acting skills william is a desperate man who has had a seemingly ideal life and doesnt want to let it go by contrast claire forlani is merely the romantic interest she gets to show joe the ropes of love but is hardly as interesting a character as joe black brad pitt seems a bit stilted granted hes supposed to be outofplace but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role still he is able to hold his own and over the course of the three hours his character begins to grow on you the main character who seems out of place here is drew jake weber an ambitious executive in williams company who is joe blacks main rival for susans affections weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily but never distractingly so we never learn what is the exact nature of death or why hes never done something like this before it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voicesaccents his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter and the ultimate resolution to one of the films supernatural problems seems well somewhat superficial still even with the films length it was a pleasant time at the movies something you wouldnt necessarily expect from a film about death but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow 
buffalo 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci gallo plays a very troubled man who was sent to jail for gambling once out of jail he must visit his parents who he told he was married the truth is he isnt married to try to impress them he kidnaps a girl christina ricci from a tap dancing class to act as his wife the film is very cheaply made and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie but you dont need money to make a good film buffalo 66 doesnt always stay with the realistic concept and sometimes goes through outrageous events gallos parents played by angelica huston and ben gazarra are two very strange individuals the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits gallo and ricci arrive at his parents house and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house riccis performance during the scene at gallos parents home are very well done there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative they seemed very mediocre but they worked out just fine gallos character is developed very well the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through his character goes through many many problems just like many people in real life this character seemed very realistic to me riccis character is funny and different she doesnt care much that she has been kidnaped in fact she falls in love the man who kidnaped her ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves buffalo 66 isnt all laughs though many scenes are very dramatic and depressing gallos character was so realistic he was extremely disturbing some scenes are supposed to come off as funny but they actually seemed sad and real to life the film sometimes drags along not giving much material i really would have liked to see gallos parents a lot more and i would have liked to see the characters developed more overall buffalo 66 isnt as good as some people put it up to be the bottom line a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom 
after being hypnotized a man believes there is a ghost in his house the review two lowkey summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year the blair witch project and the sixth sense each has made well over 100 million in north america based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising if a films box office take were based primarily on its quality stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected for it is as scary if not scarier than the other two writerdirector david koepp has given artisan entertainment the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit the story gets going after tom witzky bacon an average bluecollar dad gets hypnotized by his wife maggies erbe sister lisa douglas at a party while the hypnosis goes as expected to the partygoers it triggers something in toms head things begin to change around him blinking red lights let off a strange hum for example and he fights to stay in control of his own senses where these experiences take tom maggie and their son jake cope who tom thinks might have some answers is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you david koepp keeps the action localized the majority of the action takes place at toms house or just down the street by keeping things at home koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc unfortunately the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes also there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved though to mention them would be to give too much away kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable as are the reactions from his wife maggie kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most wife who can no longer handle her husband parts while it is still a supporting role her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls a private club that im not invited to where they whisper about things all day long as jake zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense but gets less screen time both children manage the same trick making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes it combines the dread of blair a creepy closedin feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast specifically bacon to give the fall its first genuine scary film if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more this could have been one of the years best 
being the selfproclaimed professional film critic that i am i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia coming soon to dvd until only recently after all its considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai and doctor zhivago so one day a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the buttnumbing 3 12 hours of its duration but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture director editing cinematography art direction music and sound after watching the film again i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t e lawrence during world war i lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence played by thenunknown actor peter otoole as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be reassigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i shot in panavisions famed super 70mm format the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic it is absolutely breathtaking using stunning cinematography costuming and direction shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes every shot is choreographed as a portrait a living tribute to a great land david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time a far cry from its pathetic uncreative existence today after watching the film the first thing that came to my mind was ive got to do a remake of this film but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modernday movie executive okay its going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert we are going to need to blow up a fullsize train because computergenerated effects probably wont do it justice and we are not going to use any big stars and wont have any female actors since theres no love story yes my friends the velvet curtain fell on the goldenera of hollywood a long time ago but at least we still have the proof to show all wouldbe producers and directors out there just how good a film can be 
my summer was recently saved by two very different movies on opening night i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron then a few nights later i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershmans greenfingers even though it didnt feature a trip to band camp girlongirl action or seann william scott however i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs clive owen of croupier after spending roughly half of his life behind bars he is transferred to a more lenient facility edgefield the picaresque rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges at first briggs doesnt want to be there hes used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone however his ailing roommate fergus david kelly of waking ned devine wears briggs down through his benign nature the two become friends with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers after the prisons governor warren clarke reprimands them hes awed at what briggs has accomplished and hes struck by an idea briggs fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prisons grounds greenfingers which is inspired by actual events becomes a bit like a sports movie after that despite their differences the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game in this case a prestigious garden show one renegade in this case briggs will prove to have talent of course love will also rear its head no not prison love to hershmans credit he doesnt pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs like last years lame marijuana comedy saving grace i had to keep pinching myself when i didnt see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies or the men giving highfives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers the movie deals with people and scores on that concept its wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freemans last stand in the shawshank redemption owens bedside scenes with kelly who lends the film a human touch are a marvel to behold emotionally gripping without being sappy written by hershman greenfingers contains plenty of laughs most come courtesy of helen mirren who shines as the worldclass gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose natasha little when she starts dating briggs the mother cant believe what hell do if her daughter burns the sunday roast nothing is forced in greenfingers the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines primrose and briggs relationship takes awkward steps even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield its done for reasons of loyalty not because the movie requires him to do so after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like americas sweethearts and the princess dairies its an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well 
so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton but they just dont get the good grades so many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools legend has it that if your roommate commits suicide the remaining roommates will get an automatic 4 0 chris michael vartan and tim matthew lillard are two guys who really want the 4 0 to get into harvard how far will they go to get their 4 0 chris and tim are also roommates with rand played by randall batinkoff the two scheme to murder rand make it look like a suicide so they can supposedly get their 4 0 they have heard this rumor many places and they are willing to take the chance to find out rand is a very very mean person he treats his girlfriend natalie played by tamara craig thomas like she doesnt matter at all she is very afraid of him and she especially afraid now that she must tell him she is pregnant she does tell him and he becomes enraged that night would be the last night of rands life tim and chris give rand a bottle of rat poison making him think that it is beer rand drinks down the poison and then dies now tim pushes him off of a mountain with a suicide note near the site to make it look like he killed himself it does not take long until the suicide note is found but the body isnt found the police question chris and tim about rand to try and find any information feeling extreme guilt chris is having a very hard time especially with his girlfriend emma played by keri russell she wants to know more but he will not even speak with her will he give in will tim turn chris in will chris turn tim in will they turn themselves in all of these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film the events in the curve are very surprising original and fun the plot sounds much like dead man on campus but that is not the deal with this film this film is a very serious one with not many laughs there are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films the ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying it is a terrific suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen hands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride the sound really stood out in the film it is quite eerie and it really adds to the feel of the film the way the movie is filmed is also great all of the technical aspects as well as the acting and directing aspects are very well done the performances in the curve are very good matthew lillard gets to play another creepy role just like in 1996s scream a he is very strange in this film as well i like him in this sort of role rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and shes all that michael vartan is fantastic as chris who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4 0 michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed where he costarred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student keri russell also gives a great performance she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film tamara craig thomas is also realistic especially coping with the death of her boyfriend some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case the bottom line i might just have to curve that a into an a note the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998 it was decided the film would not be released widely it is now available at blockbuster video only and for rent only see you at the video store 
available for rental october 12 1999 10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play the taming of the shrew that said drop any preconceived notions of what shakespeares work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school home of a student counselor allison janney who obsesses over the male penis a slightly too hip and racist africanamerican english teacher daryl mitchell a new kid named cameron joseph gordonlevitt a model named joey andrew keegan the subject of cameron and joeys crushes bianca larisa oleynik and biancas sister the shrew julia stiles in a marvelous performance whose name is katarina kat for short with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedicromance yet you must realize that the story is timeless and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and biancas last name stratford their family is run by walter stratford pretty womans larry miller a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor the family no dating policy is amended to bianca can date when katarina does with prom just ahead biancas fate is grim unless of course she can tame the shrew dont think this mission to be a simple one as bianca kindly points out her sister is a particularly hideous breed of loser getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing when cameron who likes bianca learns of her fathers new rule he is quick to consult a friend for advice the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit someone with money in this case that is joey the other guy with a crush on bianca camerons friend a loser by teenage verdict convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe patrick verona heath ledger this verona is far from fair rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison moreover katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso hoping to nail his leftovers the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isnt exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy a party polluted with liquor a best friends betrayal and prom it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy american pie never been kissed carrie shes all that and cant hardly wait yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare falstaff was a drunk romeo and juliet met at a party and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way 
my filmcritic com colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 brad andersons throwback to spooky horror films from the 70s it worked as an eerie homage without being selfreferential or smugly postmodern genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubricks the shining and george romeros dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative i e a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum unspeakable dread ensues in a doublewhammy for 2001 anderson shoots and mostly scores again with his eclectic riff on timetravel episodes from the twilight zone appropriately titled happy accidents much like session 9 the cards are played very close to the vest here is boyish eccentric sam deed from dubuque iowa a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your runofthemill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the presentday streets of nyc as played by wonderful character actor vincent donofrio full metal jacket its up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted the question proves to be moot at least for a time even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend ruby marisa tomei hes a freak but he sure tells a good story neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters the junkie the fetishist the artist the frenchman etc but isnt quite sure how to handle sam deed when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm his elaborately constructed fake identity his pathological fear of dogs his ability to speak five different languages and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on times alternate realities dont ask its all a bit much to take in rubys close friend gretchen cuz ya cant have a love story without the token friend though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth chalks it up as a sexy roleplaying game but her cautious therapist holland taylor warns her that codependency is rearing its ugly head again and shes in over her head with yet another doomed relationship who ya gonna believe despite her winning an academy award marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear cute to her adoring fans being loud and flashing a disingenuous smile does not necessarily equal substantial and sexy it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality then theres that damned voice which strains to be ohsoadorable look this stuff is purely subjective some people feel this way about richard gere others cannot bear to watch robin williams hyperactive schtick for my money its m tomei with a bullet happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys or more appropriately chris markers la jetee especially with those still framed memory photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logans run as the stranger in a strange land donofrio walks slightly outofstep wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion though it often falls into the scifi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition we want deeds not words at least twenty minutes too long happy accidents eventually gets around to a raceagainsttime scenario that puts sam deed to the ultimate test no movie can live in ambiguity forever but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives lets pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened shall we there are also some slow repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not hes crazy the premise is strong enough to sustain interest but its enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in halfhour time slots commercials included 
what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have i will prefer it to a bettermade film that is not as thoughtprovoking the thin red line is flawed but it provokes terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war unlike this years saving private ryan which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof the thin red line simply says war is waste while that might seem obvious to some only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs one message is not necessarily more correct than the other it just depends on ones point of view in malicks film war is set in a tropical paradise and john tolls cinematography is beyond lush the setting poses the question why are we fighting in the face of such beauty in saving private ryan the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go in the thin red line the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place they are just like the americans frightened and angry grieving and praying all that separates them is war the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voiceovers unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious sometimes corny the voiceovers tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary dispensing with them malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur instead he gets distracting selfconsciousness aside from that malicks direction is stunning the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary sean penn elias koteas and nick nolte give the best performances penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles ultimately however the thin red lines interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure but malick clearly has different things on his mind has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative what malick is working with is theme and in that the thin red line is most provoking 
mike myers you certainly did throw us a frickin bone here in what you call the biggest austin powers adventure yet austin powers the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers international man of mystery many are skeptical about sequels saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original but austin powers tswsm goes beyond the first film austin powers the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles he reprises his role as the title character austin powers the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr evil also played by mike myers from destroying the earth tswsm leaves off where the original stopped with dr evils frischs big boy space capsule floating through space dr evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 in which he plans to steal austin powers mojo what keeps austin going with spy talents upon his return to his secret lair which is now a starbucks coffee shop dr evil learns that his evil henchman which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau have created a 18 size clone of dr evil which is later named mini me the evil mini me replaces scott evil played by seth green as dr evils son in the madmans mind because dr evil thinks of scott to be only quasievil dr evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him and now he has one dr evil tells mini me you complete me in a loving manner dr evil loving wow mike myers third role is as fat bastard a scottish henchman of dr evils who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers frozen body austin powers learns of dr evils trip back into the 60s and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it once arriving in the year 1967 austin travels to his pad his smashing homedance club where he meets felicity shagwell played by heather graham a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr evil as the film progresses hilarious one liners are thrown at us mainly by dr evil for example dont go there girlfriend to the president of the united states many witty gags take place note the entire tent scene and just plain funny scenes which are so stupid theyre funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes take for example scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is the way austin powers tswsm uses its humor is clever throwing a hilarious scene at you followed by five minutes of one liners followed by another outrageous scene so you never stop laughing there was honestly not one moment in austin powers tswsm where i wasnt laughing the last film that i laughed so hard in was well austin powers it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it the film even makes fun of itself in a line something along the lines of its funny how england and southern california look nothing alike tswsm was filmed in southern california but was supposed to take place in england i can tell you one thing he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character which is all over television newspapers magazines and the movie theaters i believe that dr evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did dr evil provided more laughs more memorable moments and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away but from screenplay writer mike myers not fat bastard also making a great addition to the series is mini me who is played by verne troyer even though the midget actor is 30 years old he is adorable by dr evils side constantly the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality such as lack of character development barely any detailed plot characteristics and barely any good acting but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor mike myers with his three roles acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor disguising himself completely in one of the roles fat bastard all three characters are different and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did who gave a very flat performance in the original speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion speaking of hurley she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments hopefully graham tags along for future austin powers adventures the bottom line a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing 
it is with hesitance that i call apocalypse now a masterpiece certainly it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease and some of the finest actors of the 1970s the plot an adaptation of joseph conrads heart of darkness was set in vietnam and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant coming on the heels of the end of the war apocalypse certainly has its moments some of which are the finest in film history the plot is fairly simple captain willard sheen is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty his mission is simple take a boat up to cambodian territory and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz brando with extreme prejudice along the way willard runs into a series of adventures including one with lt col kilgore duvall and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies willard s four person crew finally make it to kurtz compound where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives willards experiences with kurtz take up the last halfhour with a confrontation and eventual ending the movie is visually breathtaking the battle scenes are exquisitely done and the score is brilliant setting a murky mood of darkness that is firstrate the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie the journey to kurtz camp is quite a ride with psychosis setting in on almost every character the most interesting one is kilgore the lt col who cares more about the surf than about the mission it is at times revolting psychotic and incredible and it is one hell of a movie the scenes are bold inventive and powerful and the acting is stunning especially be sheen duvall and fishburne the narration is exquisite as is the mystery of kurtz coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam kind of like saving private ryan on lsd the film is jarring in its implications and psychotic in its execution the problems come when the film slows down one of the major scenes in the film where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz is a colossal mess the dialogue is confusing the lighting is atrocious and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound the film slows down to a drag sheen seems forever captured by a madman played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes but is bathed in shadows the entire time making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic the scenes are poorly done the dialogue is muffled and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief sheen seems to adore this man but why the viewers are never told the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this godlike kurtz but the scenes fall way short of expectations granted it has its moments which are brutally horrific but the general feeling is one of confusion brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir and my feeling was that this could never be a great man this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him so why do they do it there are moments of brilliance but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending the finest scene at the end is sheens escape and his entrace into the temple his rise out of the water with the smoke coming off of his slicked head is a brilliant 30 seconds of film yet you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times and indeed the film on the whole is very good it is a stunningly flawed expression of film for it addresses major issues such as mans mental stamina during bouts of war but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful had the character of kurtz been more explored and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece but it could have been so much more rewarding 
the verdict spinechilling drama from horror maestro stephen king featuring an outstanding oscarwinning performance from kathy bates geez french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this sorry nonbritish readers may not be familiar with french and saunders my apologies the pair are british comediennes jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in absolutely fabulous who did a series of film spoofs a few years back including alien the exorcist and misery needless to say amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates the resemblance was quite uncanny dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunders legs but despite the lingering memory of their sketch and although ive now seen the film a couple of times now that hobbling scene was no less disturbing im still left screaming at the telly in revulsion that may be the most memorable scene but its certainly not the only worth watching stephen king whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale its a nicely crafted psychological horror which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon james caan rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes bates who introduces herself as the writers number one fan he soon becomes her prisoner both the script and kathy bates beautifully masterful performance for which she won an oscar work arminarm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruitcake or is that fruity as a nutcake bates relishes her demanding role and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour at times shes a rather tragic character and more often than not shes just damned scary this is basically a very simple tale but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity its an involving engrossing experience and considering its basically a twohander mainly set in one locale its a remarkable piece of cinema there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences this one relies solely upon rob reiners stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan oh i havent really mentioned caan yet he does a good job as the writer whos a prisoner of his own success annie is obsessed with him and his books but as you no doubt gathered from the above bates is well and truly the star of the show along with the pig of course anyway the tension is builtup with masterful aplomb and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense theres the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerveshattering lengths to poison her wine he succeeds but she knocks the glass over i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well in the immortal words of homer j simpson doh other nervewracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house we cut to annie in her car shes on her way home he realises this and tries to get back to his room cut to the car again shes getting near will he make it ok so these sequences arent exactly original nor perhaps unpredictable but they work boy do they work if a film has you on the edge of your couch biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense then its doing something right of course the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned hobbling annie realises her captive has been out of his room and shes going to stop him once and for all cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer and i feel ill just thinking about it nasty it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho and then were given one of the most ridiculously overthetop fight scenes ive ever seen she gets hit over the head with a typewriter set on fire head smashed against the wall and she just wont die sheldon isnt in terribly good shape either if it werent so gorey it would almost be laughable but its a terrifically effective film and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked misery is a tight tense intense and chillingly entertaining thriller the directing is firstrate and the performances bates in particular contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem wonderful stuff for more regularlyupdated film and tv reviews check out my site http www geocities comhollywoodbungalow4960 
an indian runner was more than a courier he became the message he was carrying what danger is a bear to a message i used to think sean penn was an immature arrogant photographer punching madonnamarrying loudmouth but all that has changed now the guy has grown up and thats not all it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director if this film is any indication one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper but no this film is about a real struggle and the victories and defeats are not simple penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters without unnecessary rush or flash the focus of the story is two brothers david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer viggo mortensen is the wild brother whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he cant name much less resolve the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared the film is unobtrusive simple direct plain and sincere it isnt exactly perfect but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems this is a good film without big budget sets or big name stars pushed into your face in fact im reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified though there are a few freeform sections which also work very well the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche but what are you going to dothis movie does take place in the 1960s after all in my opinion it is worth fullprice admission 
seen july 8 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 albany ny theater 7 at 8 15 p m with my mom using hoyts cinema cash theater rating 12 very good sound picture and seats its very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters lives but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do therefore gone with the wind deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner its a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself the film takes place in georgia before during and after the civil war this plays a major factor in the films success to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers can a story set so long ago be relatable now the film confronts all these problems paradoxically by not cronfronting them it doesnt simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media without which what is there to build on were given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters especially our main character scarlett ohara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time she knows how her society works wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be being the most soughtafter woman allows her to manipulate men and their women to ensure she gets her way whether it be obvious i e who will be the one to get her food or subtle i e getting married just to spite someone the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him he isnt so arrogant and demanding as scarlett in fact hes engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable characters one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friends but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her and the love she has for her husband her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesnt give her much emotional selfdefense acting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story as a whole is the daper stongwilled cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable hes quite a character all right everyone listens to what he has to say even though hes got a bad reputation butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior he tells everyone the muchneeded truth in the rigid castelike society where freewill doesnt seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition for example in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners theres no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out this angers them not for his lack of faith but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factories do we have food do we have a navy all we have is tobacco all true statements and yet the south still insists hes wrong butler is a shifty character to be sure but he takes such pride in his arrogance its appealing scarlett notices this too when she first sees him and from the look butler gives her we know hes not going to stop until he has her but scarlett cant get past her need for ashley and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever and so the story goes on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dies this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story some are vital for only a few scenes but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film in most films only a few characters exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these types of simple approaches are never taken the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no not my leg dont cut off my leg another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street but as the camera pulls back we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers but it is their moaning thats more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be as the second half begins the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who singlehandedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north she manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she has cant help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the souths ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each uses the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett cant help but want her more every time she tries to oneup him such as marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposites attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities it borders on magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaves it up to us to make this call both have things the other wants and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film were left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture all none either way is possible and its a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings its safe to say most of us wont live such overly dramatic lives as those in gone with the wind but its still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that weve just experienced a lifes worth of joy and pain 
not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets lies like bergman director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations also like bergman leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ravished and wracked faces and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergmans own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film all that is missing is a discussion of god which is not to say that secrets lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master in fact it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind nonetheless what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place that it takes some effort to adjust to the films rhythms once the adjustment is made however there are great rewards one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is though leigh may have adopted some of bergmans stylistic touches most obviously in an early scene of terse crosscutting during a married couples strained conversation as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any style at all whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality leigh makes the camera a mere observer almost as in a pbs documentary the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors it is a tribute to everyone involved that despite such scrutiny only infrequently are we aware that anyone is acting much has been made of brenda blethyns performance and rightly so but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is there are a few missteps for one except for one scene tragicomic as it happens there is scant humor in the film this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout and occasionally as with bergman the bluntness of the situations can seem forced for all that this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film in fact it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it there is even a sweet but significant irony in the films unspoken take on race relations something an american audience at least would do well to observe nonetheless secrets lies is not for the faint of heart though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen needless to say it is also very depressing at times but for many of us of course so is life and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better 
after a successful run in australia last year and with much critical praise heaped upon it muriels wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america muriel heslop is a withdrawn overweight young woman living in porpoise spit australia she is often the target of her fathers frequent rants at the family and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage her selfloathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired after her four cliquey friends dump her muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls and muriels wedding unfolds from there toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma easily winning the audience over with an honest painful performance collette basically carries the film appearing in almost every scene muriels father bill the battler heslop is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politiciandeveloper while chumming around with young fans and crowing you cant beat progress his slogan bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments rachel griffiths plays rhonda who becomes muriels cheeky new friend in the film she has good chemistry with collette and the film suffers when griffiths is offscreen muriels tormenters played by pippa grandison rosalind hammond belinda jarrett and sophie lee are twodimensional caricatures all saucy vain and bumblingly spiteful though that is probably due to hogans scripting muriels wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm hogans use of abba tunes which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack is interestingly appropriate although its repetitiveness tires after awhile hogans script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriels earnest quest for acceptance and the gorgeous scene with muriel windowshopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch muriels wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p j hogan on my four star scale i give muriels wedding three stars 
every once in a while a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise i dont necessarily mean in terms of quality rather im referring to the mere knowledge of its existence usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo it has slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just as quietly thats a shame because princess caraboo is a delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing whats more its surprisingly insightful and provides a sharpwitted lesson in english social history princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england involving a young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by goodhearted gentlewoman mrs worrall wendy hughes her banker husband jim broadbent is nonetoopleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs worrall however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo as a social satire and comedy of manners princess caraboo is a winner it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mrs worrall he is a bit too close to them for comfort while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and cowriter michael austin keeps the treatment too lighthearted to be heavyhanded he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes as the princess becomes a sensation at court in one of the films best sequences princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in sensations an idea that takes on a timeless quality and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment the performers are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime her supporting players are also appealing wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs worrall kevin kline as frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea as the worldweary but ultimately romantic gutch only john lithgow is a disappointment turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princesss identity the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isnt given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there when it finally does blossom it seems too quick to be plausible princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp still it has both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewardinga hidden gem 
 through a spyglass i could see everything king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 1793 but instead of visualizing this act of regicide legendary auteur eric rohmers the lady and the duke observes from afar consider it a view to a kill made abstract a proper british yes british gentlewoman grace elliott lucy russell and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope often muttering i dont know as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air what we dont see might not be able to hurt us just close your eyes and think of england during times of revolution the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them adapted from elliotts memoirs journal of my life during the french revolution rohmers latest artistic tourdeforce may seem far removed from his domestic comedies tales of the four seasons etc a period film set during the most violent changes in french history resisting the temptation for grandscale theatrics much of the lady and the duke is about quiet decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist a headstrong snobbish blueblood one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own graces life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover the kings hotblooded cousin prince philipe duke of orleans jeanclaude dreyfus the times are changing though and the gears inch ever closer toward violence during the september massacres of 1792 she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the dukes sisterinlaw on a stake rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil old fashioned almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob in doing so he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not the face of death when grace sees her friends disembodied head on a pole rohmers attention drifts from the societal change to one womans reaction shot laden with hot tears grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice sheltering him from the mob through her relationship with the duke she seeks a passport for this one activists escape grace doesnt even understand her own actions and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers ceaseless police monitoring house searches even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life her imperious attitude to the servants never changes she becomes a heroine through circumstance the events themselves are intrusions upon her person her home and therefore her values aristocracy proves a glass house one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones the duke is called to vote on the kings punishment and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors talk means nothing in the face of bloody action or futile inaction the episodic structure creates a wobbly jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification lazy viewers and critics may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke thats foolery but brings up the valid criticism that rohmers characters occasionally become didactic rohmers imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmers use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism the actors were filmed against a bluescreen then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wideopen streets it looks as phony as titanic but unlike james camerons debacle the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone why they arent real the very foundation rohmers characters stand upon is false and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves in all their insubstantial glory screened at the 2001 new york film festival feature coming soon 
wong karweis fallen angels is on a purely visceral level one of the most exciting films ive seen in a long while unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for ordinarily that alone would be enough to sink a movie but in the case of fallen angels this is not so every shot in this film is exciting just to look at wong does really interesting things with the camera but he doesnt allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over as was the case with last years dismal knock off which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe ugh the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives i cant say much more than that as i didnt really know what was going on most of the time in fact it wasnt until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character the constantly moving camera doesnt really allow for the audience to associate with any one character were always kept at a distance from these people i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters fallen angels is a refreshing changeofpace from most hollywood films which never bother to try anything different at least on a visual level in fact id go so far as to say that fallen angels is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film ive ever seen sure theres directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images there were far too many instances during fallen angels in which i asked myself now who are these people again is this that first couple or the second couple it was impossible to keep track perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which by introducing them to us with name cards as in scorseses mean streets thats really besides the point though wong karwei has proven himself through very few films thats hes a moviemaker to watch lets just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies 
city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most thoughtprovoking moving and completely unsentimental i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality city of angels is a wonderful film enhanced by interesting and wellrounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years its a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story and avoids most of the cliches were so used to seeing in films like this city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders 1988 film wings of desire i have yet to see wings of desire so i am unfortunately unable to make a comparison of the two i have heard however that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways which makes me glad that this film isnt a ripoff of its source material nicolas cage stars as seth an angel who like all of his angel counterparts is present to lead the dying to heaven or somewhere just like it one day he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr maggie rice meg ryan and his attention is called to her the angels can make themselves seen to humans but they cant experience any of the senses most importantly touch he shows himself to maggie and she falls for him unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status seth wants to become human so he can feel her thats when he meets nathaniel messinger dennis franz former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race as a side note i found messinger to be the most fascinating character for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel i know it sounds ridiculous but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally welldone after much deliberation she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel this of course is when seth decides to take the plunge literally from a building when he wakes up from the fall he is human and happy to feel what its like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead since i love this film so much ill make a minor note that it certainly isnt perfect although it is original and mesmerizing it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic though the details are what make the story excellent and steel has done a great job with them the ending too could have been more powerful and less predictable these elements are minor though and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels the acting is superb from everyone involved this is perhaps my secondfavorite performance from cage my favorite being the rock hes quiet and pensive and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softlytoned words hes perfect for a role like this and at the same time he reassures us hes not bound by playing the psycho though he is good at it as he shows in faceoff meg ryan is a powerful enticing and appealinglychirpy actress and her work here is some of her best dennis franz however steals all of his scenes as the energetic formerangel what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation director brad silberling is a talented man and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters rather than forced sentimentality his direction is steady and he shows this in just about every scene near the beginning maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead there is no music or elaborate camera work we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information this is the way stories should be told and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do cinematographer john seale the english patient provides some of the most stunning images ive seen on the big screen hundreds of blackclad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours just as an example the music by gabriel yared also of the english patient is perfect for this film its quiet and moody music but not sentimental and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre its a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story acrossthe excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously 
have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally at any given moment in life or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world or outside of it these thoughtprovoking questions are the subject of final destination which is the most riveting horrordrama since 1999s the sixth sense stylishly filmed and tautly directed by xfiles alum james wong the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters in accurately written teenspeak rather than overwrought highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldnt use all the while developing into a darkly foreboding severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the lesssuccessful but still suspenseful epilogue at the start of the film 17yearold high school senior alex browning devon sawa is about to leave with his 40student french class for a field trip to paris progressively getting a case of preflight jitters he spots several mysterious coincidences including the departure time being 9 25 the same as his september 25 birthday as well as hearing the john denver song rocky mountain high over the sound system in the airport bathroom john denver died in a plane crash alex grudgingly mutters to himself once seated alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff and after causing a ruckus onboard he as well as six other students and a teacher are thrown off arguing in the airport lobby alexs suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight killing all 300 passengers including the rest of their classmates as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode the fellow survivors whom he has saved treat him in varying manners carter kerr smith the hotshot jock holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate alexs best friend tod chad e donella wants to stand by him but cant because of his fearful parents the teacher mrs lewton kristen cloke is frightened by him believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker only outsider clear rivers ali larter who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alexs premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life that is only the setup of final destination and the less said about what follows the better suffice to say the film does indeed turn into a slasher film albeit one that is more thoughtful than most and replaces a knifewielding maniac for the neverseen granddaddy killer of them all the grim reaper itself the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes and final destination surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner they manage to occasionally be so intense you dont know whether to shrink down in your seat tap your feet in nervousness or turn away devon sawa a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999s underseen slashercomedy idle hands is even more of a charismatic presence here the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival which he comes to believe he wasnt meant to do as well as the loss of the other passengers is superbly and subtly acted on his part one scene in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful ali larter 1999s varsity blues in the other central role is also effective as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish manthe exact opposite of her nowdeceased father the other roles are not as fully written and most remain rather onedimensional the movie is mainly sawas however and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles tony todd 1992s candyman as an arcane morgue attendant pops up for a fiveminute cameo but his appearance is rather supererogatory and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy ultimately what is so good about final destination is that within the confines of the slasher genre writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films if anything its safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again

 well this is not mission difficult mr hunt its mission impossible difficult should be a walk in the park for you agent swanbeck sir anthony hopkins the series new agent phelps takes ethan hunt tom cruise down a notch a russian scientist rade serbedzija has created a new virus and its antidote called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection a rogue imf agent sean ambrose dougray scott wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause posing as ethan hunt ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoffhall thandie newton to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods ethan and nyah fall quickly in love but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambroses reluctantly he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah although the first mission impossible film was a moderate box office success audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasnt much action although being a fan of the series both old and new i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry robert towne and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo the end result is one of the most entertaining yet simple action films made in a long while unfortunately the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow dwelling mainly on ethan and nyahs quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission impossible tv series ethans conflict is a compelling one but it seems very rushed and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed closeups the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film thankfully though at the point ambrose discovers nyahs deception mission impossible ii becomes very entertaining and actionpacked robert townes screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a highrise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus after that the action scenes just begin to build in intensity as is the case with many of woos previous highoctane films the final half hour is an all out assault of action a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer unfortunately as far as summer entertainment goes mission impossible ii is serviceable fare anyone looking for hardcore action wont be disappointed except for during the first half of the film perhaps even if you werent a fan of the first film this entry deserves some checking out pg13 
robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible godgiven gifts but are able to act like ordinary people in the natural 1984 he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who was destined to be the best there ever was but still acted like a humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 he was the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly goodlooking charmer even in indecent proposal 1993 where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the bestselling novel by nicholas evans redford again plays such a character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses was just too good to pass up despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses a magazine article coins the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life bookers talents are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson was recently in a horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gutwrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses an eighteenwheeler kills graces friend severely wounds and traumatizes graces horse pilgrim and causes grace to lose part of her right leg annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed as well which leads her to booker at first she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesnt work instead she packs up grace and pilgrim leaves her husband robert sam neill behind and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sisterinlaw diane dianne wiest in many ways the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal and its hard not to see annie and graces leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the characters arrive in the wideopen spaces of montana that graces anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate annies controlling nature begins to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed a river runs through it six years ago in many ways the horse whisperer comes from the same poetic vein as river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less cameratime on the grass and mountains but then that would ruin the magic much of the films photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killers platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which takes place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 85 1 aspect ratio when the action shifts to montana richardson switches to softfocus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a 2 35 1 aspect ratio in terms of the story itself the horse whisperer gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david leans a brief encounter 1945 and clint eastwoods 1995 adaptation of robert james wallers the bridges of madison county richard lagravenese coscreenwriter here also adapted bridges although the horse whisperer has a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband whos being left behind for this brief heartsweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddyduddy husband falls to sam neill he plays the character as a decent hardworking man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert looks somewhat frumpy and outofplace in a baseball cap as they enter the pen booker assuredly swings over the fence while robert hesitates then opens the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him its a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movies thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scenes in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although bookers horsetraining methods are mythical and unrealistic the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film there are no dramatic sex scenes but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moments like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission 
in roger michells romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends its name to the films title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia roberts walks in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an onagain offagain love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film opens with a nonverbal cue to annas stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actresss appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such without words this sequence gives us a background to her character following however is a setup narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives i dont know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldnt have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movies beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from williams point of view as he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily in fact much of notting hills strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that hes even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honeysoaked apricots from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldnt say a word then adds well ill probably tell myself now and then but id never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we dont get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible were constantly exposed to williams thoughts feelings actions and desires but dont actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that were not sure what shes been thinking all the times in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grants film hands down he gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actresss top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her characters unpredictable behavior anna doesnt get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans as spike williams eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh hugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as williams friends and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sisters birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst its a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation roger michells use of visuals doesnt sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as williams walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air were generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a birds eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the films scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect its kind of a mixed bag but still fares better than many of todays lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hills grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the alltime greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and thats not so bad now is it 
ingredients man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers synopsis what if you woke up one day and suspected you were not on earth and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers in dark city john murdoch rufus sewell has this problem dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trenchcoats as well as by the police and the dogged inspector bumstead william hurt is john a murderer and what can his missing memories tell him he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues but when the clues dont fit it doesnt just confuse him it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city to john something is fishy and very unreal about this city how come its always dark and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city or how to get to nearby shell beach every night around midnight john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation and at this time creepy alien experimenters known as the strangers come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into peoples heads with big hypodermic needles the strangers have the ability to tune or warp reality using telepathic powers turns out the city is not on earth at all and the reason why john doesnt fall victim to the nightly suspended animation is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same godlike realitywarping abilities as the strangers even with the help of scientist dr daniel schreber can john take back the dark city opinion director alex proyas he also directed the crow mentions this in the dark city press kit in films science fiction is always used to have big spaceships blow up cities i think were a little tired of that according to director proyas probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers its designed so that you can watch the film over again and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch its a philosophical piece cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens whether they be klingons giant bugs or proponents of the dark side of the force but science fiction in books reaches beyond the shootemup level and targets the big questions questions like who are we what is the human condition what is ethical what would a true human being do far from comic book style on the order of spawn batman or the mutant ninja turtles dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay a little more than 200 years ago the world was filled with unhappy peasants unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian military conformist medieval regimes the people took refuge in religion the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering but after death heaven would be available meanwhile the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven when science finally overturned religion the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud kant kafka nietzsche and dostoevsky pondered what society should be and what place the individual had in it the existentialists in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile indifferent or alienated universe in dark city when the last dying defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens scientific experiments on the human beings brains failed murdoch replies pointing to his head because the human condition isnt located in here 
every once in a while when an exceptional family film comes along i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children it is remarkable how many nondisney films disappear in a couple of weeks now i see that in so doing i have unfairly ghettoized these films so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents but to anyone who wants to support smart funny energetic filmmaking see matilda see it in a theater rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video see the best film i have seen in 1996 not the best childrens film the best film period based on a story by roald dahl it tells of young matilda wormwood mara wilson an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents harry danny devito a crooked used car salesman and zinnia rhea perlman a simpleminded bingo addict the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists and when they do it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books when they finally do send her to school it is to crunchem hall a bleak place run by cruel childhating miss agatha trunchbull pam ferris but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher miss honey embeth davidtz who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness matilda also discovers another special talent the ability to move things with her mind which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbulls cruelty it was this springs james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton matilda soars on the cockeyed direction of danny devito devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses and he contributes some memorable images in one scene an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pigtails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer later an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale it is also characteristic of the best childrens tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost dont realize that they are learning them there is a hilarious moment when matildas televisionaddicted father snatches away the book she is reading in a wicked joke he thinks moby dick is pornographic and forces her to watch an inane game show hosted by jon lovitz in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child that because im big and youre little im right and youre wrong more specifically it has as its heroine an intelligent selfconfident girl who struggles successfully against other peoples notions of how she should behave it is no coincidence that matilda was cowritten by robin swicord who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women finally matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word devito knows enough to make matilda fastpaced and appealing to children taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy including a great chase through her dark house the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character but there are also many many delights for adults including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matildas classmates recite in singsong fashion there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matildas father i cant imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling i will see it again and years from now i will watch it with my children and now i will stop because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin and there is a seat in that theater you should be in if you have a child or ever were a child 
usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock others will mention meg ryan but for me its not even close janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now and its a good thing shes starring in the matchmaker because without her presence the movie would be bland unfunny and dull garofalo stars as marcy tizard a top aide to boston senator john mcglory who is suffering in the polls in an attempt to capture the irish vote he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglorys that never moved to america unfortunately for marcy her visit coincides with the towns annual matchmaking festival things get off to a rocky start for marcy though she has no hotel reservations for no rational reason and the tiny confined room tired old cliche she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub his name is sean and marcy finds him repugnant at first so you can obviously tell where this is headed the movie runs into a few roadblocks for instance the story is very thin none of the characters except the old local matchmaker are nearly as interesting as garofalo some of the characters like the political aide played by denis leary have wandered in from a completely different movie i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery and several closeups of garofalos winning smile the strange thing is that it works garofalos charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories and it carries this one

 i know what you did last summer the first highprofile slasher thriller to be released after 1996s scream and written by the same screenwriter kevin williamson is a stylish effective horror film that became 1997s biggest hit of the fall season while scream was a more knowing film about the genre i know what you did last summer is more reminiscent of a straightforward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottomofthebarrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the friday the 13th films well okay jason goes to hell was pure hell to sit through the film starts off with four talented aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport n c it is the 4th of july and they will soon be heading their separate ways kindhearted julie jennifer love hewitt and outsider ray freddie prinze jr will be headed off to college while helen sarah michelle gellar who has just been honored croaker queen in the town and her ignorant jock boyfriend barry ryan phillippe are going to new york to become an actress and football player when the four of them travel to a nearby mountainside beach for the evening they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home distraught and confused they decide they cant go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean in hopes no one will find him julie is apprehensive about it but is forced into it by barry switch to exactly a year later julie still unable to come to terms with what she did reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out almost immediately julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads i know what you did last summer and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook i know what you did last summer is a successful horror film for a number of reasons the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian as it put shadows fog steam and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings the characters particularly julie and helen are realistically written and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort and last the film creates a few dazzling and scary setpieces that are some of the most memorable ive seen in a horror movie particularly the suspenseful superbly shot sequence involving helen at her familys store with the killer inside with her perhaps the best character is that of missy egan anne heche a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit heches performance is a standout as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time i know what you did last summer could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems prinze jr gives a performance to be desired here and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth also the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines luckily the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale which includes an expertly crafted jumpinyourseat scare in the main roles hewitt and gellar are highly talented and hewitt especially is one of the best screamers ive ever heard she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best scream queen and gellar is touching as a young woman who in the course of one year finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered although not up to the level of either scream movies or the more recent urban legend i know what you did last summer is a respectable smartlyscripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made 
labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classics despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors producers werent thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones on the other hand producers were right on the mark walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america to make the movie even more distant from future plot was loosely based on anabasis historical book written by xenophon greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago instead of ancient persia movie begins in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warriors local youth gang gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city the gathering organised by gramercy park riffs most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warriors home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riffs announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogues led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raids the gathering and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing and their leader gets killed by riffs the remaining eight led by cleons lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs upon its release despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status however despite being one of the best movies of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hills idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america he failed miserably the future was much worse than his vision the youth gangs as presented in the warriors are far from shadowy armies able to take over entire cities their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matters like crime in their vocabulary word arms is reserved for small knives and blunt objects and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns they even have their own very strict and detailed laws upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour despite those objections the warriors have all the elements of a very good film the plot is simple and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isnt much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb events happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his wouldbegirlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains michael beck as cool almost statesmanlike leader of a gang is also very good and james remar gives good contrast as his hotshot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies 
for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and high art the sons room is an inventive subtle alternative written by directed and starring nanni moretti it takes us through the slow complicated path of bereavement slow is the best description for the film at first it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal happy family father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities they laugh spend free time together and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome but suddenly the son is found to be dead after a diving accident the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it but can also be trying on the attention span though the film drags and even repeats itself this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production it doesnt come across as a vanity piece one might wish he hadnt picked the profession of analyst for the father giovanni which he stars as if only because this makes his characters reactions so predictable what saves it is a well written script with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative or that remind a depressed person of loss you start to take notice of the cracked dishes ignored when familial bliss was in full swing you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block and not necessarily huge events like graduation even better are the role reversals that take place within the household while giovanni and paola laura morante do check up on their daughter irene jasmine trinca there is a sense of being on autopilot not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more shell make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic unexpected change respectfully gender issues never enter the picture selfpropelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama speeches and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing in contrast the sons room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning denial depression anger bargaining acceptance through each of its main characters its not the most engaging 100 minutes but it is certainly easy to relate to 
the word rest in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all what does takes place is more based on character development the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people nick beth carol and sid what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield arizona to butte montana and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different carol is nicks exgirlfriend and beths best friend sid is a jointsmoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in obviously based on a stage play the problem with the movie is that theres a lot of things left out its not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other the reason why nick was fired from his job isnt mentioned and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery when he hasnt seen them for many years set in a small fictional town in arizona was a good move since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings the name of the city is not important this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with but ill keep an eye on her in the future interesting trivia this was rated r in the us but rated barntill ten in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it 
airplane is considered among many to be the epitome of satire filmmaking after all its brought to us by one of the best known satire writingdirecting teams even if most people dont recognize the names behind the films they are bound to recognize the titles airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shots to name a few but although the zuckerabrahamszucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 airplane remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debuts in the seventies disaster films seemed to be at an all time high films like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hits there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane a series that spanned the entire decade and so in 1980 we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had to do with bad fish airplane is the story of ted striker robert hays an exfighterpilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrades unable to stop living in the past teds world fell apart he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job and eventually as we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty in a desperate attempt not to lose her ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her which leaves him wallowing in selfpity in the midst of it all something happens someone gets sick then another then another soon the whole plane is full of deathlyill chicagobound people and when the pilots get sick played by peter graves kareem abduljabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day gee i wonder of course the main draw here is the nonstop whizbang comedy with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags although i had seen this movie a few times before i was still laughing thru the entire thing the most fun character by far is the doctor played by leslie nielsen hes a dry subtle sterotypically straightfaced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film in a film like this youre not really expecting an elaborate production so one cant complain about the amateurish quality what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played by stephen stucker this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny i dont know why he was put in there and i dont think anybody will find a good excuse and when the film nears an end it slows down quite a bit almost getting old you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long aside from that airplane is really a topnotch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends especially if they havent seen it and if they ask what the plot is just tell em its a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but thats not important right now if youve seen the film youll understand 
this is the movie not the perfume a slow moving stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcocks vertigo it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader set in new orleans 1959 it shows the wealthy michael courtland cliff robertson sitting on top of the world celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion as his lovely wife elizabeth genevi ve bujold and young daughter amy blackman both look up to him beaming with joy his realestate development partner bob la salle john lithgow proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business while his high society friends give him their best wishes upon retiring for the night his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver 500 000 tomorrow or they will be killed inspector brie stanley reyes comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange as that will lead them to the kidnappers but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase the kidnappers car explodes and goes over the bridge where none of the bodies were found grieving the loss of his wife and child the guiltridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence italy where he met his wife when he goes to the church where they met he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife her name is sandra portinari genevi ve bujold and shes working there restoring art that is decaying he falls instantly in love with her and doesnt heed bobs warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him the surprises to come werent really all that surprising as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ve bujold and the competent acting of john lithgow it plays too much like a rehash of the masters work to break any new ground yet it is still thrilling in its own way

bob the happy bastards quickie review the mummy brendan frasers stuck in the past again but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone fraser is the lead star of the mummy the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising its a rough adaptation of the 1932 film and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages like boris karloff was engulfed in but who cares the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you cant get from oh say godzilla or armageddon fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground basically its a little sign from the mummy buried underneath a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress his plan wake back up and wake her up also making him invincible of course fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian rachel weisz and her brother john hanna along with a former buddy of his deep risings kevin j oconnor and some americans and guess what yup ihmoetep arnold vosloo awakens and wreaks havoc fire flies from the sky flesheating beetles crawl about and well ihmoeteps plan begins to unfold ok so its not really all that new a story but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch and the acting from fraser and weisz isnt half bad either the action is pretty intense favorite scene the sandstorm and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horrorloving folks as well no its no phantom menace beater but if youre looking for a solid warmup to the summer movie season you wont find a better film under wraps than the mummy if this doesnt give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man then nothing will 
the laserman somehow the title of writerdirectorproducer peter wangs film conjures up images of superheroes like ultraman and spiderman you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips as it turns out the laserman is about crime and about laser beams but there arent any superheroes instead wangs film is populated by a group of refreshingly offbeat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot new york city the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity eccentricity and electricity the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss marc hayashi a chineseamerican laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds arthurs professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas his personal life on the other hand is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives in fact arthur is by far the blandest character in the film despite a charismatic performance by hayashi the san franciscobased actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii its the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark arthurs notsotypical jewish mother ruth for example is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body she has dyed her red hair black she takes herbal medicine daily and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies such as matzo balls in soy saucethe ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it almost stealing the movie in the process she plays ruth as a driven woman determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture arthurs girlfriend janet maryann urbano is a kooky freespirit who would rather meditate than copulate her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation arthurs best friend joey tony leung is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns joey is married to arthurs jewish sister but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house arthurs 11yearold son jimmy played by the amazingly adorable david chan ishorror of horrorsbad at math he finds it impossible to meet his fathers lofty expectations the various people in arthurs life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity like wangs earlier film a great wall about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china the laserman revolves around cultural differences every character in the film is in some way or another trying to find his identitystruggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way the movie also offers a provocative look at technology wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu a detective who is fed up with machines even though he relies on them to do his job the film views technology with a wary eye acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers wang raises the timehonored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions was einstein responsible for the abomb is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers the movie pits spirituality against technology man against machine and the result is a draw according to the film technology has its place but we must employ it with great forethought and caution ironically by its very nature the laserman is a triumph of technologythe technology of filmmaking wangs direction is exquisite especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically crosscuts between the various subplots perhaps in homage to d w griffith cinematographer ernest dickerson who has worked on all of spike lees films gives the laserman a distinctive artistic look mason darings score which includes a sendup of bach is right on target the laserman is an ambitious endeavor which is to be applauded but its sometimes ambitious to a fault wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that its hard to digest them all for instance one character arthurs sister has negligible screen time and consequently we just dont care about her marital problems in weaving his web wang has included a few too many strands overall however the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction on the surface the film is a light and bouncy comedythriller overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town 
imagine this youre given a sword and a shield and very basic minimal training a man you dont know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die you frantically monitor several closed doors which in seconds will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you you know youre going to have to do it all over again tomorrow eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are youre going to die this is the life of a gladiator youll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scotts powerful gladiator youll be thankful for that with his new film scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire and like those preceding it spartacus and ben hur gladiator has nearly everything going for it a strong lead actor a wonderful supporting cast eyecatching special effects and a great script since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator teenagers to thirtyyearold males were around a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited from a weak beginning the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious romes best general maximus russell crowe who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted is currently in the year 180 a d that is waging a war against germania scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective its blurry in slow motion and the sound is muted as soon as this artistic method began it was hard to tell what was what and who was who its a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch instead the general swears he will get out after this battle he wants to go back to his family and his crops he wants a quiet life but unexpectedly he gets anything but that the dying emperor of rome marcus aurelius richard harris decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators all of this does not go well for aurelius son commodus joaquin phoenix who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor jealous and upset commodus kills his own father names himself emperor kills maximus wife and son and attempts to kill maximus but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius wishes now a slave the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator who eventually are released for their success a story of betrayal and promises gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick you actually care about the characters sometimes even the evil villain commodus who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way phoenix plays his character brilliantly think of commodus as the percy wetmore of pantwetter the green mile of the roman empire a whiny sleazy respectmebecausemyfatherwasagoodman brat who hates when hes not the center of attention every scene we see commodus hes either crying or he looks like he has just been crying phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for and gladiator shows hes more than just rivers little brother crowe is also excellent as the films grislyfaced hero maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act hes no invincible superhero who only blurts out oneliners he believe it or not acts like a human being the rest of the cast including richard harris djimon hounsou walter hill derek jacobi and connie nielsen are also first rate ridley scott using outstanding special effects has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum the loudness of the roman mob and the city of rome in general the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous like a cleopatra of the year 2000 the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upperclass politicians gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience along with u571 action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 
so here is the second of 1999s remakes of classic horror movies the first was the dumb pathetic but ok remake of the classic the haunting now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 000 to stay in his house if they survive the night they get the money if not well you get the jurisdiction having not yet seen the film dvd on its way i wasnt sure if i would really like the remake but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on geoffrey rush in a fantastic role with an incredible performance is steven price the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list somehow someone or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party eddie taye diggs an exbaseball player sarah ali carter an exassistant who can rewire anything melissa brigette wilson a talkshow host in sorts dr blackburn peter ghallager and watson chris kattan a smartmouthed humorist in ways what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 000 000 dollars if they can survive through the night if they can they get the money if not well they dont the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr there forcing him to lock the place up because if he died so did they everyone who was in there burned to death now it is steven prices home and he is throwing this party for these five people what starts out as a seemingly normal night turns into a horrifying blood splattering night the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed onebyone the people start to disappear conspiracies start to turn up and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all the people find rooms which once held mental patients rooms which once had people dying rooms which may still contain these people now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house and they must survive each other with terrorfying results since i officially havent seen the original i cant say which is better i can say however i liked this movie geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price and does a great job doing a vincent price role famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy and even sometimes downright scary i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous one thing i knew not to expect was a haunting type movie with special effects galore even though it had fantastic gore and special effects the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget which doesns show all the way through but you can tell the movie was written well and its only major flaw is the underdeveloped characters and plot holes that we are left with the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise i was expecting another haunting with special effects no scares and a dumb ending instead i found a good halloween movie with gore scares and great acting house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really cant take seriously though it is a wellmade movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws but besides that the movie is fun smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this cant be made all the time 
apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer apart from swashbuckling braveheart director and former actor ron howard splash backdraft far away most noted for his dramatic film making displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer with more than us150 million in the states alone this film is his most successful effort yet perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks gump himself kevin bacon footloose tremors a few good men etc gary sinise forrest gump bill paxton aliens true lies boxing helena and ed harris the abyss just cause all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight the worst being the challenger accident jim lovell hanks the mission commander together with his crew fred haise paxton and last minute replacement tom swigert bacon are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission more than three quarters way to the moon suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home if they ever reach it ed harris and gary sinise who play respectively the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles both delve into their roles superbly audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space also there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well thanks to filmmusic maestro james horner watch out for the launching sequence it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film a bad point though apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script those who consider themselves scientifically illiterate might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show this is however just a minor point just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film you should enjoy it 
in daylight sylvester stallone breaks no new ground cinematically speaking but he covers familiar territory quite well yesterday as i was going about my business in the university bookstore i noticed this stand with these daylight movie posters on it i had never heard of the movie so i stopped by to check it out it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering so i shrugged thought hey they probably wont give me the card anyway and i could always use a free movie so i signed up all in all i dont think i got that bad of a deal either rob cohen who has previously brought us such films as dragon the bruce lee story and more recently dragonheart gee i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason you think now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture with fx by industrial light and magic about the aftereffects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey sylvester stallone plays kit latura who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in cliffhanger a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed when the crisis hits he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out there are other similarities to cliffhanger too perhaps the only real difference is that cliffhanger had a villain where daylights bad guy is mother nature in fact had the two movies been made in hong kong this might have been titled cliffhanger iiit bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film sequels do to their predecessors the first halfhour of daylight is setup subplots are woven and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled we meet all the important people toxic waste disposal truck drivers a young frustrated jilted rejected playwright a family struggling to stay together an older couple and their dog a truckload of prisoners an ad agency executive a tunnel police officer stallone and others we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons and then thirty minutes into the film boom and its a big one from there on in its sly stallone to the rescue and rescue he does enduring batterings beatings falls repeated immersion in 34degree water explosions mud rats and constant setbacks before going on to save the day slystyle again theres nothing new here and yet there doesnt need to be the fun of daylight is not in the story but in the execution the specialeffects are firstrate thanks to industrial light and magic and the ensemble cast works well together once the film hits its stride it carries the viewer right along to the finish with very few jars along the way this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e meadows permission granted for distribution through rec arts movies reviews and all associated archival permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached all other rights reserved to the author 
perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects there is no question that actionadventure and sciencefictionaction movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years such as raiders of the lost ark were made in grand traditional fashion contemporary films like jurassic park are multimilliondollar creations of computer technology the latest in this visually awesome series of movies the wachowski brothers the matrix is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movies story unlike many scifi movies which promote themselves as effectsheavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the films length contrary to popular trend the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound in this regard the movie is something like a card sharp with its flashy mass stripped away the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented the script is characteristically weak and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach but like the card sharp the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent the viewers dont care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner and right around the corner they usually are for the script tells a fastpaced albeit frequently revisited story as the movie explains the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence the matrix farms our life energy only a select group of individuals knows of the real world and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultracool morpheus laurence fishburne morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo keanu reeves believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion the set design is very dynamic running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy the costumes as well as the actors who wear them add to the roles for instance the manifested antagonists in the movie a group of agents created by the matrix in its computer program all dress in matching secret servicewear the rebel fighters on the other hand dress in rich hues of leather the casting cannot be criticized for the typically stoic reeves isnt required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool supports in carrieanne moss joe pantoliano and hugo weaving are all effectual one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last years science fiction masterpiece dark city particularly if one ponders how this same premise wouldve worked from a different approach the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear here the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrillride motion picture with little abandon and much noise the better picture between the two depends on the viewer but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun 
let me open this one with a confession i love cop movies i adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers steven was it any good well just about as good as baldwins steven seagal impression for those ive confused the answer is a resounding no now let me clarify i dont love just any cop movie im not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker im partial to those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these films come along just about as often as george w bush makes a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie does hit multiplexes i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out 7 50 for a movie called one tough cop which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spinoff no truth is im a sucker for those barren streets that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches yes its all very corny and awfully boys clubish which im guessing is precisely where these feelings come from as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joes enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos as an adult my tastes havent changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring now what if its the cops whore the corrupt ones ooh that one really gets me going these protectors using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw a courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a subgenre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved the film stars treat williams who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city i cannot provide an answer as to why it didnt though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves like mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didnt make it to where he should have if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacinos in serpico also directed by lumet williams plays danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty prejuliani streets of new york they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies to gain access to the big wigs and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice danny has done this and though hes a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a double agent he does so with one condition he will not rat on his partners right away we know that that is exactly what hell have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet as well as a handful of intense performances most notably by treat lumets greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking lumets worst tendency is one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isnt as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumets most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable of course cop movies arent popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isnt gay the lame comic relief character whos never funny and on and on for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills it focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies theres a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if hes about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the words out hes lost his voice does that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in a sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence its nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things 
carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town she goes to college in california there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore who is a city boy when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving she brings shore with her and her parents lane smith and cindy pickett are less than thrilled dan gauthier guginos boyfriend from high school proposes to gugino gugino isnt ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end forget jurassic park cliffhanger the firm and last action hero soninlaw is the film to see this summer soninlaw is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers especially fans of the wiez when soninlaw is long gone and forgotten the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen although the basic story line has been done many many times before the film is still fun to watch the laughs are plentiful especially when the wiez is around the way some of the jokes are done are new even though some of the jokes are old there are also several new jokes that at least i havent seen before still when presented right even old material can be funny still this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesnt contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price the cast for this film does an excellent job pauly shore encino man is the star attraction of this film he is great and knows how to entertain the audience pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl she makes her character believable on some levels yet interesting at the same time the person who played the grandfather mason adams i believe also does a great job the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen patrick renna who played guginos little brother was a little annoying but no where as near as macaulay culkin and for only part of the time so i can forgive him tiffaniamber thiessen a killer among friends saved by the bell does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television she wasnt given overly much to do in the film but what she had she does a good job with 
the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam fitting since the mediasaturated gulf war became a pop entertainment while driving through a long flat iraqi desert in a humvee with a bart simpson hood ornament one of the men under special forces sgt maj archie gates whos steering command requests a beach boys tune these men want their apocalypse now moment only instead of surfing they bop to the music and skeet shoot out the back of the vehicle armed with automatic rifles our three kings okay four are good fighters but they dont necessarily take operation desert storm seriouslyits a reprieve from their hellish day jobs they are gates new father sgt troy barlow wahlberg sgt chief elgin cube and pvt conrad vig music video director jonze at storys start president bush has declared a ceasefire and american troops are tying up loose ends barlow elgin and vig discover during a round up of iraqi captives an assmap that points to a bunker filled with gold bullion gates leaves his jurisdiction to commandeer the situation he proposesdemandsthat barlow elgin and vig join him on a treasure hunt ditching his escort a relentless reporter named adriana cruz nora dunn is easy so is finding the treasure until the four men realize the magnitude of discord still breathing in iraq saddams men are threatening the dictators detractors citizens of his own country with violence when gates and company arrive at the bunker with a stolen truck ready to loot the unarmed rebels want help bush encouraged them to rise up against the government but provided no military support for such cause gates convinces the vaults guards that this is a postwar mission and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck the situation could go off without a hitch the former enemies bear no grudges but the money hungry gates has a conscience and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene he orders barlow elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces the result barlow is kidnapped and the filmmakers imply that these wouldbe kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device his interrogator lost his family to the bombs and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child he does in chilling lasting images i liked these scenes best because the political became personal its one thing to champion the plight of thousands its another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib russell has shocked us before his first film spanking the monkey is about a young mans affair with his bedridden mother its great his second flirting with disaster features a character who has an armpit fetish one could argue that its easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions though russell disturbs us in three kings by being nononsense about the violence when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home russell mutes the soundwere paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast three kings is russells first visually arresting picture stylistically it stands apart from other war dramas newton thomas sigels cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy which is of course entirely appropriate one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen a friend enthusiastically added its like having sand in your eyes this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade three kings was shot in arizona california and mexico russell throws plenty at sigels camera for it to observeas was the case with russells previous efforts the most absurd moments are also the films most realistic even the most poignant we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside if anything three kings settles down and stops surprising us its climax is pure hollywood no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indieminded russell subsequently the characters become more cartoonishbarlows posttorture revelry felt phony and chief a strong presence in the first

blandly heroic protestormarching with the rebels i waited for him to shout let my people go hayseed vig notwithstanding the protagonists are very intelligent and selfserving too i had a glimmer of hope based on russells filmography that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture its not spoiling much to write that then again what historical importance would such nastiness serve theres already enough cynicism in the films mentioning of kuwaits oilinfested waters russell offers the masses a primer on the oftdismissed gulf conflict and pulled off a neat trick a

bill condons gods and monsters is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classics frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whales inner fantasies and hallucinations whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him as the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film a dirty old man in one of the opening scenes a young film enthusiast visits whales home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesnt really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as a motion picture director rather than a horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whales first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life as played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as a sad but dignified man and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself he never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in a deadend job as a gardener of peoples homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is goodlooking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him since whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is a little thin and the structuring of the onagainoffagain friendship at the films center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds in lesser hands this setup might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end walking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellens marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is a sad testament when a persons true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one elses business in the first place 
i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of good will hunting based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film in which the main character will hunting matt damon an mit janitor in his early twenties is discovered to be an einsteinlevel closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight the only problem is that will is a tough street kid whos had his share of runins with the law and before long hes being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight professor lambeau stellan skarsgard who had brought up the math problems in his lectures tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police will is to be released provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff but good will hunting rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and wills therapist sean mcguire robin williams lambeau wants to get will to use his brain while sean wants him to listen to his heart both of which he has been largely neglecting will finds that the former is much easier than the latter so much so in fact that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeaus attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar minnie driver an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her what makes good will hunting work so well aside from the strong performances especially from damon and williams is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in wills life the scripts sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong lambeau while he may seem a little cold at times is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when were not sure if we like what he has to say and sean for all his warmheartedness has as lambeau and later will point out not lived up to his full intellectual potential either the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will wills reaction to this situation and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions rather than setting up an obvious right and wrong side and beating them over the head with it for a film with such an extraordinary character good will hunting presents itself as remarkably ordinary it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally farfetched situation good will hunting also has its share of fun humor such as when will in an early therapy session pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa wills relationship with his friends most notably chucky ben affleck is usually rather amusing if somewhat crude the film has 100 uses of the f word which was most likely the reason for its rrating and lends itself well to the development of wills character add all this to the fact that good will hunting even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental and you might be wondering why i havent given this film four stars well for one thing no matter how well damon and affleck who wrote the screenplay and director gus van sant pull it off the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions still good will hunting takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of 97 films 
a cinematic version of one of john irvings novels is always cause for celebration even if as in the case of simon birch the treatment is merely suggested by rather than strictly based on the book suggested means that irving author of the acclaimed the world according to garp sold the rights to his novel a prayer for owen meany to the disney machine for 1 million but wouldnt grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names thats an odd decisionirving claims its to protect both himself and the novelbut its one that doesnt unduly harm the finished product irvings books are rich and complex works full of intriguing colorful characters a prayer for owen meany is no exception it tells the story of an unusual boycalled simon birch in the film versionwho is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a highpitched falsetto voice like strangled mice simon believes himself to be gods instrument placed on this earth to somehow effect gods plan simon is played by ian michael smith who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which among other things prevents bones ligaments and joints from developing normally smiths debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for simon birch however the producers unwisely favored form over functionsmiths acting abilities are limited at best another drawback is that in the book simons condition is described the way irving describes any of his charactersin careful loving detail watching simon birch however creates a different feeling altogether the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character surely something irving would not have intended simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating a combination of smiths rookie status as an actor and the precocious oneliners hes forced to deliver courtesy mark steven johnson the films director and screenwriter fortunately simon birch isnt the real star of the film that bears his name simon is more of a catalyst allowing his costars to shape the story and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances saving the film from an obsequious manipulative destiny first and foremost is joseph mazzello jurassic park who is nothing less than remarkable as simons best friend joe mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old ripe with laughter pain and tears he is certainly an emerging talent ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca joes single mother and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend ben david strathairn and jan hooks play the towns reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others theres even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from well that would be telling perhaps suggested by the novel is the appropriate way to go after all since simon birch only focuses on one chapter one year of simons extraordinary life the film also changes the books ending to one that is more melodramatic yet necessary given simons lot the flavor of irvings original novel remains howeverthe passions friendships and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown maine and the engaging oddballs both big and small who reside there 
the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ which explains why the bards materials are such a popular source for remakes revisions rewrites inspiration subtlety credit and dispute indeed in recent years american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products including this years upcoming a midsummer nights dream shakespeares material has been the cause for twentysix big screen productions since 1990 but for a change of pace mrs brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love marc norman and tom stoppards story is largely fantasy although as the viewer soon learns shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously will shakespeare of the 1590s wouldve been married to anne hathaway and he wouldve had a teenage daughter and two young sons here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play and his current comedy in the works romeo and ethel the pirates daughter just doesnt quite seem right with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe rupert everett and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps gwyneth paltrow he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies romeo and juliet the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet to great effect fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy the supporting roles are well filled out from geoffrey rush as wills worrisome agent philip to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman even ben affleck leading the troupe of actors manages to make a favorable impression and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i gwyneth paltrow is by far however the standout of the lot creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance the story is wellcrafted if nothing else although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the lets make a movie genre the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted and certainly accessible by the audiences lowest common denominator theres something for everyone in this romantic comedy making it prime date flick material although certainly not inspiring in any regard it revels in a wholesome wellrounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998s pictures the truelove story is one of the best around certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent yearsopen releases is just around the corner 
in 1912 a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world and she was she was also build to be one of the most luxurious and that she was finally she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not to get a ticket for this voyage you either spent a lifes savings to get to america to start life anew were part of the upper class and had the money to spare or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson jack dawson makes the trip and happens to be at the right place at the right time rose dewitt bukater a first class passenger climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue and a tale of death and tragedy this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia the movie titanic shows what happened maybe not with a 100 degree of accuracy but it still shows it very realisticaly now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story it serves as both admirably brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is but that alone is not enough the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they arent acting but are actually the characters in the movie the casting for the movie could really have been better in my humble opinion that is one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself yes you read correctly the ship is a character how is the titanic a character you ask well simple a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this mr cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp now to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening if your imagination is good the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique the movie will leave you amazed at the effects and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie just humans and an oversized ship the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end the historical value of this movie is quite high and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy for it is extremely well done the method of telling the story is also good maybe not totally unique but effective none the less regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing if you get the chance to see this movie go it might not be the best movie in the world but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie 
the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future after a sort of confusing bit involving fakelooking cyborg things the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while make that every 1000 years or so an evil force comes to destroy earth the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element the plot in this movie really isnt that important to the thing though this movie has very good special effects for the most part the technoish music in the background fits the mood very well bruce willis is an illegal taxicab driver in a futuristic new york city one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk this movie is about what happens the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations also there is a fair bit of action in the film particularly towards the end some characters are just plain strange including a highlyenergetic deejay in drag bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down it is one of those scifi films where youll be saying cool followed by a what the hell i give the fifth element 
note some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers be forewarned james tobacks return to directing after a eightyear layoff two girls and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girls carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue embracing a near realtime approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering characters fortunately the films cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the films setup is fairly generic in nature and opens rather unpromisingly we meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft as they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that theyre both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport and it doesnt take long for them to come to the realisation that theyre being twotimed by the same guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for a confrontation its when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights its fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the films best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others but by his own innate behaviour whether hes flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds carla lou and his unseen sickly mother its never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a oneman show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the sparks begin to fly one of the great touches in the film is how blake when startled by carlas unannounced appearance begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag doubleteamed by the understandably aggrieved women who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this film however itd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lous outrage to full featurelength and its as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the films tempo loses its liveliness the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequences fall flat subtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter longrunning dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene contractuallyobligated to deliver an rrated film mr toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc17 rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled from selfassured to disconcerted yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered its a wonderful performance in a role customtailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr downey jr was arrested on drug charges and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blakes selfchiding to get his shit together is disquieting in its resonance while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles ms graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses involving herself in three successive risky projects two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman shes quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile ms gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing she tones it down substantially as the film progresses but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox the film was reportedly shot in eleven days filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girls and a guy has an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one senses that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesnt feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is wellused to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner two girls and a guy falls short of its potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr its still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends im an actor he tells them at one point using the ol triedandtested occupationalhazard defense actors lie but not they all seem to agree denzel washington 
robert altmans cookies fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good it is a sunny delightful dreamy comedy filled with lovely performances skillful direction and topped off with an understated clever extraordinary script as this is an ensemble piece it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs first we meet willie charles s dutton an honest man with a slight drinking habit we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness despair and want of her dead husband we cut to camille glenn close who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora julianne moore then we briefly get acquainted with emma liv tyler an apparent relative of cookie who is a downbutnotout teen outcast still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live we also fleetingly see emmas lover jason chris odonnell an ambitious but far too excitable young cop we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband she exclaims here i come and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself soon after her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl comes upstairs finds cookie dead and flips out convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow yet sweet sister that it was a murder she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well scattering jewelry all over the floor breaking a few cabinets windows and doors and then throwing the gun out in the back yard the only reasonable suspect is willie who immediately gets taken into custody and put in a jail cell they all know he didnt do it so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma meanwhile the unperturbed camille continues her nonetoosubtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success so begins cookies fortune a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as a southern spin on fargo except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers darker somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade robert altmans slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well in that both films focus on and off on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town indeed most of the characters in cookies fortune are loads of fun to observe and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi dimensional glenn close turns in an insubstantial in terms of her career but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie and she is perfectly cast as the prolific aunt alexandria character endlessly obsessed with family dignity the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s dutton mimic a time to kill there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours even days after the film ends cookies fortune is such a movie i loved the light kindhearted approach altman whose last project was the dark intense drama the gingerbread man took towards the tricky subject matter i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast i even liked the trite in the south everybody is related to everybody cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close im not sure why cookies fortune had such an allaround pleasing effect on me perhaps its that good ol southern charm 
well ill be damned the canadians can make a good movie the world is coming to an end we dont know why or how but apparently there is no way to stop it the world has had this information for months as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations yet for a handful of toronto citizens life goes on they arent going crazy or attacking people in the streets instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end some engaging in activities theyve always wanted to do some gathering with family and friends and others just seeking to be alone these peoples lives however all intersect during their final six hours writerdirectorstar don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth craig callum keith rennie tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies a gas company employee david cronenberg calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business and patrick mckellar just wants to be by himself but isnt having much success even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to tying everyone even closer things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film but ultimately everything comes together nicely although its not a happy film some moments are understandably gutwrenching the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances particularly from sandra oh whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight in toronto anyway but i do wonder why the sun never sets come midnight the sun is still shining brightly maybe the sun is crashing into the earth who knows also its comforting to know that in mankinds final moments on the planet people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus thats not a shot at this film mind you i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars last night is available on dvd from universal home video it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer r

i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so liveactiondisney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins separated at birth by divorcing parents never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again and everyone should know how i feel about remakes especially of films i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless youre going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list and was actually quite the opposite contemporary liveactiondisney films are not one of my favorties anyway theyre usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 this one however is shockingly not bad in fact its actually good not the original good but whats great about it is that it doesnt necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining because its cute and innocent fun because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parents are also immensely appealing and im repeating myself because its cute and innocent fun theres nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and its aimed directly at either kids adults who want to remember the original or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid i personally am somewhere between the second and third i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasnt so weird or diverse the names godard and kubrick werent even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abcs wonderful world of disney where theyd show you a liveaction andor madefortv disney flick an hour per week i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of childrens animated halfhour shows made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldnt dare missing i can even remember seeing the madefortv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap its more of a late childhood movie because it deals with the issue of divorce but it deals with it in a disneyized version its playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood id probably dismiss it id probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadnt seen the original at such a perfect age watching it i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seeminglyperfect parents splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fuckedup of situations things could always work out if you well manipulate things a bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but its also charming in its own way it has a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a liveactiondisney flick a tone that isnt corny or condescending but just right the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kids actually know better than the foolish adults the story is basically classic by now repeated almost as many times as kurosawas the seven samurai a pair of twins played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mills in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parents one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she lives with her parents and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz as she works as a swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sports and pokerplaying the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudomaid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look alltoo similar and are thus in tight competition which results in some nasty pranks which winds them in seclusion together in a private outoftheway cabin there they become friends then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent whom theyve only heard of they learn about eachothers lives in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously earpiercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer comes they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesnt necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original but she comes off just as appealing as she did once she does though add a couple new things she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also adds on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake ones accents arent exactly perfect shes also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actors are especially in their first films she makes a great protagonist and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasnt been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past not just that hes mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasnt ever been this likable period the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning as maureen ohara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original during the opening credits we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the films more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraineinducing way as in many such films this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasnt really existed since well the original film years ago still my money the best liveactiondisney flick of all time this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a golddigging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix whos deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film a treat instead of a bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it takes two starring the olsen twins because it treats the children as the smart ones and the adults as the silly ones not the other way around and because above everything it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better certain scenes work well but not nearly as well as they worked in the original i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard hawkscary grant films of yesteryear and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences as such this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances 
gere willis poitier chase each other around the world the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when the soviet union imploded the western countries lost their shadow with the united states friendly with the russians we no longer had an entity to blame for the worlds problems this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy its time to rejoice because weve found our new villain now its no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands its the russian mafia a perfect solution it combines the dread of organized crime and the stillpresent uneasiness with the former eastern block countries best of all the villains are still foreigners fear of the other always plays best so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal bruce willis to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone theyre not sure even exists coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen richard gere who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston sidney poitier and russian major valentina koslova diane venora mulqueens exgirlfriend basque terrorist isabella mathilda may is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his 70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesnt slip away crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his minivan the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller the day of the jackal comparison between the two films is inevitable there is no doubt that the original is the better movie playing the story for suspense rather than the current actionadventure as a mystery the jackal has enough holes in it to ruin the tale but if you can accept it for what it is theres entertainment to be had holes lets see a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up for a 20year veteran that can command the big bucks the jackal is an incredibly poor shot the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police but its just the two of them willis disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmers in the saint and lest you misunderstand thats not a compliment but the three stars are fun to watch its good to see gere in something other than a business suit willis has a mixed history in picking projects but his characters are always watchable poitier is by far the superior actor but has limited screen time the problems in logic are flaws but dont ruin the experience occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes this is one of them the appeared in the 112097 bloomington voice bloomington indiana 
its terribly unfortunate that stir of echoes tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of 1996s unsung treasures the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night and although they have eerily similar storylines stir of echoes is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business stir of echoes is more conventional and predictable in its final twist and where the sixth sense was disturbing stir of echoes is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago stir of echoes opens with a cute sixyearold boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks does it hurt to be dead apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isnt the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hardworking wife one night while at a party with their closest friends tom convinces maggies newage sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldnt normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months seeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didnt expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes isnt a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horrordrama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling workingclass family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 1997s dream with the fishes are topnotch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet in a masterfullydone entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantlyconstrued as this one truthfully this setpiece and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having loads of fun with her small role as maggies sister lisa illeana douglas 1995s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about toms visions of the girl she remarks i wouldnt be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that shes dead gives one pause also of note are jenny morrison 1994s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in 1998s whatever as morrisons grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesnt what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the offkilter frameofmind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realisticallywritten characters stir of echoes isnt as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is a spinetinglingly good horror film 
usually when a blockbuster comes out its loaded with effects stars bad scripts and plenty of action mystery men may contain an allstar cast and efects but the clever script and characters are what really works which is rare to see this year the film is based upon the comic book series the flaming carrot by bob burden in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime only to be out done by the real hero of champion city captain amazing greg kinnear things go a little haywire when the sinister casanova frankenstein geoffrey rush is released into the city where he captures captain amazing and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city well the trio decide to take matters in their own hands by saving the city but first they need some assitance this is where the film takes a turn for the better in the beggining there were only 3 wanna be heroes blue raja hank azaria mr furious ben stiller and the shoveller william h macy sure they were enterataining but their acts grew old fast that is until they aquire invisible boy kel mitchell and the bowler janeane garafalo and mr splein paul reubens 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess thankfully the original 3 heroes become amusing with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen the whole premise is rather ridiculous but packs a few punches to keep interest for one the film is considerably clever it literally pokes fun at super hero films like batman and robin superman etc in fact many scenes are similar to batman and robin including the opening sequence only altered in a humorous and superior way a part of the cleverness comes from the cast sometimes a film with such talent is overblown but the acting is what keeps it alive here while azaria and macy were enteratining 2 characters really stood out one was paul reuben no matter how disgusting or revolting mr splein may be you still cant help but laugh it so incredibly moronic its just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions janeane garafalo also was an interesting character she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem due to her enthusiasm that kept the film flowing men is worth seeing alone for those 2 troubled heroes on the downside a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off kel mitchell and geoffrey rush were both utterly useless their parts were so limited theyd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes ben stiller too was wasted mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue none of these characters get a rise out of anybody but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film as far as the budget goes it was wisely spent on the cast not the effects while the set designs and action all look nice im glad there was a seperate aspect that the film focused on and for that i applaud slow at times and rather pointless mystery men still delivers it forgets about money making because its not likely to make a bundle like its proceeders and thats what works stupid maybe but for once im not disappointed no one expected an intelligent film but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year 
review peter jacksons the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie and still coming in at the extremely cheap 30 million price tag but for those who were dismayed by this years blockbusters like twister and independence day the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a highprofile movie can get michael j fox stars as frank bannister a con artist who can speak to ghosts he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people then he comes and pretends to get rid of them this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago franks latest customers are a young couple played by trini alvarado and peter dobson when dobson ends up dead alvarado starts to take an interest in fox but dobsons spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive hes dead this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado with dobson tagging along as a ghost things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims but noone else can see that so when fox shows up to try and save each victim naturally people suspect he is the killer fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collectors hit list and the last half hour of the movie deals with foxs attempts to save her from this evil spirit there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh the movie starts off as a black comedy and ends up a horroraction film the mix between these genres are perfect no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror and vice versa one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form michael j fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wifes death and then is forced to confront this later on alvarado looking like andie macdowell makes a great frightened tough and smart heroine and jeffery combs as a paranoid fbi agent is brilliantly bizaare the frighteners never once feels like it is running long the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters this movie is probably what casper wouldve looked like if david lynch directed it its easily the best film of the year so far 
before you read my review you gotta know that i love woody allen this is a very important note because allens films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius while others see him as a dirty ol schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again i love most of his films but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s in fact why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me if you look at the quality of those films youll hear what im saying the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives in fact i secretly hoped that he would take some time off at the turn of the millennium just to reenergize or something but it doesnt appear as though he has any intention of doing that so here i am again reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old plot the year is 1940 and woody allen is a topnotch insurance investigator his methods are very oldfashioned and apparently out of date a new employee hunt has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency the two do not like each other one night they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician and unbeknownst to them placed under his control soon thereafter jewels are stolen words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer critique a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies with the fasttalking witty banter between coworkers a catchy jazz score moving things along film noirish elements such as the veronica laketype sexpot oneliners galore and a fluffy if inconsequential plotline on the downside the film actually starts off pretty slowly with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy the sets on the other hand were amazing the production design and costumes were perfect and the casting ideal so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man but it wasnt not long before i was fully engaged by the characters entertained by the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt and actually interested in the resolution of the flick i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old parody and actual reinvention note therons entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool of course films like this with little or no real tension in the plot need solid actors to keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue and once again allen does a great job in playing his character who for once isnt his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude he actually plays a macho guy here and handles it pretty well especially the scenes in which hes hypnotized but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt an actress who i was openly sick of seeing in movies late last year sorry babe you were just in too many at the same time anyway shes really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men and doesnt miss a beat of allens fastpaced dialogue i didnt care much for her running joke about him dying whenever he left a room but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did yum yum harumph but i digress so lets recap a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score some funny oneliners especially in the second half a decent plotline although you shouldnt expect a real mystery or anything and some solid acting all around i cant say that this is even remotely close to any of allens best work but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through its probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute oldschool kind of vibe with chemistry between the leads zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion little known facts about this film and its stars annie hall 1010 celebrity 510 everyone says i love you 510 husbands and wives 910 mighty aphrodite 510 small time crooks 710 when harry met sally 1010 youve got mail 410

what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber to answer the question you get director david mirkins new comedy romy and micheles high school reunion romy white mira sorvino mighty aprhodite and michele weinberger lisa kudrow tvs friends have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 however when former classmate heather mooney janeane garafolo the truth about cats and dogs confronts romy about the 10 year reunion she is astounded that she forgot watching pretty woman for the umteenth time they are reminded of how they wouldnt let julia roberts character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance then it hits them they are not successful what are she and michele going to do romys instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames bag a couple of boyfriends and get jobs romy says this will be easy but michele retorts that if it is so easy why hadnt they already done it robin schiffs script keeps the show moving with some nice oneliners one of the best has romy reminiscing about her lifes battle against the bathroom scales i was so lucky getting mono she says looking at her thinnest high school picture that was like the best diet ever the casting for the film is so perfect that one begins to suspect that the leads were chosen and then the script was developed romy and michele use their high school yearbook to discuss the caste system at their high school the films editor david finfer dissolves the stills from the yearbook to live action flashbacks which makes the past come to life at sagebrush high the hierarchy consisted of the a group cheerleaders the b group drama club and the c group nerds romy and michele were none of the above ridiculed as the weirdoes they were constant targets for abuse even though they were quite attractive they had so much fun being together that they did not care about the others that they make their own outlandish clothes helped keep the wall around them complementing romy and micheles lightness is janeane garofalo as the dark pudgy heather mooney heather who invented a new cigarette paper for cigarettes with twice the taste in half the time for the gal on the go has the success and the money that they would like heather was even more of an outsider than they were in high school garofalos onedimensional role is only a side show this is a two person film with the other characters there merely for the two leads to bounce their lines off of the genuine chemistry between sorvino and kudrow makes for a sweet and sometimes touching comedy they have so much fun acting out their parts their enjoyment spreads to the audience 
martin scorseses triumphant adaptation of edith whartons the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900s but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorseses finest newland archer daylewis is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ryder a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may countess ellen olenska pfeiffer cousin of may walks into archers life archer is immediately captivated and finds himself in love with ellen archer is also bound by the limits of new york society which is an intrusive as any other in the world archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status the films subject matter may seem alien to scorsese but the theme is definitely not it is a theme of forbidden romance guilty pleasures and the consequences causes because of those actions there is a painstakingly flawed hero and his choice between the life he wants and the life he is destined for in truth it is a film about a society the audience doesnt know about but wants to find out more much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun the performances are absolutely breathtaking daylewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well ryder is probably the gem of the group for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot and slowly pushes daylewis closer and closer to his eventual ending the supporting cast is also wonderful with several characters so singular that they are indelible in ones memory scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery his script is also excellent slow in buildup with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed it is difficult to make a period piece gripping scorsese however does it beautifully the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere he is patient but he films everything and anything remotely important the cameras sweep pan track and do more than theyve ever done but they are so subtle one doesnt realize hes watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot but the viewer doesnt notice it because we want to see more of this gorgeous world there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding and joanne woodward narration is exquisite not a fast film like goodfellas this shares more in common with kundun than anything else and like kundun this is a slowstarting film that truly shines when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year

wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and thats too long for this epicwannabe that plays more like a tv miniseries than a movie the story opens on the earp family farm with young wyatt ready to run away from home he wants to fight in the civil war but his dad hackman has different ideas and wants his son to study law time passes and wyatt heads west returns home to marry and after a spell begins his career in law enforcement by the time he costner and his brothers madsen david andrews and linden ashby arrive in tombstone wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards wyatt earp is very appealing in places such as cast costumes and cinematography but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches somber is fine just ask clint eastwood but this film that boasts not one not two but three count em three hammy death scenes still a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff his uh unusual relations with women for example are an intriguing contrast to his characters credo of nothing counts as much as blood equally amusing is a buffalohunting and skinning sequence that is decidedly nonpc director lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach to the gunplay the infamous gunfight at the ok corral is both brutal and brief devoid of almost any theatrics dont look for much glorified violence here despite some large exclamation points in the story the characters do come to life the diverse cast includes everyone from betty buckley to mackenzie astin kevin costner is very good in the title role dances with whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires though but his transformation from lighthearted law student to stoic sheriff is fun to watch he was tougher in a perfect world his foil is dennis quaid who pulled a deniro by losing 40 pounds to play the tubercular terror doc holliday gaunt and gamely hes a scene stealer whos seen too little other familiar faces include tom sizemore looking like bruce mcgill bill pullman looking like jeff daniels and lea thompson looking like someone other than lea thompson both gene hackman and isabella rosselini appear and disappear like magic while late entries catherine ohara and jobeth williams are surprisingly solid though the story and score shouldve tried less is more all other credits are technical tops production designer ida random art director gary wissner and costume designer colleen atwood are some of the vips who helped spend what mustve been an enormous budget clearly no expense was spared 
when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called the postman i thought an american version of il postino starring costner god help us when i found out that it was not a remake of postino but an postapocalyptic epic i thought landworld please god make him stop as it turns out the postman is a much better film than i had expected despite being set in 2013 the movie is at heart a western a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back the setting however allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it costners nameless character a wandering actor rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem will patton a former copymachine salesman turned bandit king our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman taking the uniform and bag of mail he passes himself off as a representative of the restored united states he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets one young disciple ford lincoln mercury larenz tate organizes a fullscale postal service ford spreads the postmans message of hope until bethlehem finds that the oncemeek villagers are beginning to resist his rule as war breaks out between bethlehems army and the postal workers costners character steps into the legend he created and goes from selfcentered loner to leader of the revolution his lie of the restored united states becomes a selffulfilling prophecy postman is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wideeyed optimism sort of sergio leone meets frank capra but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling what could have been another knockoff of the road warrior like waterworld was surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble tate is the standout in the movies large cast ford lincoln mercury selfnamed is the polar opposite of odog tates character in his debut film menace ii society 1993 and tate makes fords innocent belief in hope as convincing as odogs cynicism and brutality his performance sells the movie interestingly as tate moves from his usual streetsmart roles to youthful optimism the softeyed patton who usually plays nice guys proves a disarming villain olivia williams makes her film debut as the postmans love interest abby when they first meet abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile predictably the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero however their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored she torn by grief guilt and anger he resisting his destiny the postman is costners best work thus far perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future 
in zoolander the worlds most successful influential and intellectuallychallenged male model derek zoolander wonders is there more to life than being really really really good looking obviously the films creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a featurelength movie out of his hilarious vh1vogue fashion awards shortfilm subject can there be more to this film than being really really really silly no of course not and it never aspires to be anything more much like derek zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie its not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy and it never produces any gutbusting laughs except maybe a scene when dereks model roommates all die in a tragic gasoline fight accident a riotously funny takeoff of tommy hilfiger ads but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles wild characters and performances and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused better yet this exaggerated version of the original threeminute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu will ferrell drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed enter derek whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel owen wilson takes the spotlight on the trail of mugatus plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries stillers reallife wife christine taylor and shes hoping to use mugatus pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme much like the austin powers films zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today wilson is hysterical as the young vain hansel ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant freakish mugatu in the same way dr evil upstages everyone in austin powers jerry stiller bens dad whos best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld makes a priceless turn as dereks slimy agent maury ballstein even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged largeassed masseuse as for ben stiller it seems his derek has one gag hes stupid which plays out in some uproarious oneliners unfortunately taylor seems out of place and out of her league here maybe its just because i cant stop seeing her as marcia brady who she played in both brady movies making her unbelievable as a dowdy brainy plain jane who hasnt had sex in two years she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo who wouldve added real comic substance to the flimsy role while zoolander is hardly highbrow its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days zoolanders no masterpiece but a very worthy distraction

if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films its their predictable endings the devils advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does unfortunately for the devils advocate this ending nearly collapses in on itself and ruins the entire film nevertheless the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film i dont think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan well it does contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones at that the devils advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session kevin lomax keanu reeves is the defense attorney working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl he ends up with a notguilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he flies to new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer he graciously accepts where he is treated almost as a god he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck his life seems to be on the rise and of course his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice especially if it is not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people he spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while things turn completely upsidedown as kevins wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevins real father is it all just a big nightmare or is john milton really satan playing tricks with kevins life the devils advocate plays out fairly straightforward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we dont expect is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devils advocate messes up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early i went into the devils advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didnt like the ending the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way the devils advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again as for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study the film runs like a wellbuilt clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for a nice resolution which does not occur it was at this point that i felt cheated taking us on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the film everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game i dont want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devils advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned its r rating for a reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isnt subtle about anything showing us everything it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc17 rating as it is quite harsh however the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those i dont condone sex and nudity in films but if its there i might as well enjoy it the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary anns problems are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted something the devils advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature the story actually has something to say about humanity in one of the last scenes john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children he is satan of course he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity then god sets up rules which contradict human nature this semireligious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devils advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but im sure they came straight from the novel it was based on when a film has something to say about our society it deserves to be watched the cast of the devils advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we dont expect heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does a great job probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves he has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself with this performance i have never seen him more believable to date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris buellers day off also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevins past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times one familiar face with a twist was coach star craig t nelson who gives a very good performance the devils advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at 144 minutes this film moves along fairly quickly for the first two hours i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effects and a good musical score director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early 
ingredients downonhisluck evangelist church synopsis sonny dewey robert duvall is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife farrah fawcett in bed with another guy in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guys head and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder and estranged from his wife and two kids to atone for his sins sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature the apostle e f as the apostle e f sonnys main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple but sonny knows his time is short one day the police will find him opinion this movie is a thoughtprovoking look at an evangelist in real life terms i believe that robert duvall who is the producer director writer and main star of the apostle deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film duvalls portrayal of a true believer is authentic superb and inspired it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion as well as a portrait of a fallible complicated man driven by his beliefs incidentally in real life duvall was just as driven in getting the project underway since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done paying for its production with his own money about five million dollars in terms of hardhitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film similarly those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thoughtprovoking experience on the other hand the apostles main strength duvalls preaching is also what limits the apostles target audience in terms of plot and pure entertainment value the apostle is definitely not for everyone teenagers action fans comedy fans and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church in other words the apostle is a four star performance but with a very limited audience 
the most amazing thing about paul coxs innocence is how unlike a movie it is i mean that as the highest compliment if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40yearold romance id want to run and hide the sex scenes would be handled as a farce producers would shed 20 years off the characters ages so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence along with a charming romantic story the australianbelgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable the romance gets started when former musician andreas charles bud tingwell learns that his true love claire julia blake lives nearby they decide to catch up on old times but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair complicating matters is andreas frail health and claires longtime husband terry norris who cant understand why hes suddenly become obsolete in my mind the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire than the feelings of everyone involved john claires husband endlessly questions what he did wrong claire initially insists shes a grownup but admittedly behaves like a child a prospect that thrills and disappoints her andreas an agnostic begins to question his fate a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence cox litters the movie with flashbacks including the repeated vision of a roaring train its a reminder of andreas and claires past love as young lovers they met by train but as it recurs we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed a pall is cast on the whole affair a master of the understated cox strings together a series of memorable moments in andreas dream sequence amidst the roar of the train and conversations we get the whole picture of andreas and claires love we also get glimpses into john and claires relationship during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward claire admits to john about her indiscretion telling more than any monologue could all thats heard is the scraping of forks against plates the characters are unlike anything ive seen theyre people so many times movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky or theyre reduced to comedic buffoons ordinary people with a pile of emotions claire and andreas arent sure what the next step is they do want to be happy which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what theyve known throughout their adult lives bravo to cox who wrote the script for not making john a monster so that claires affair is automatically justified norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claires love difficult to accept we feel for him hes a decent man sure he may have become complacent but he never expected this especially now with so much presented to the audience its only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive which it does however in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers cox displays a skill and lan isnt likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon 
contact is a film that tries to do several different things it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the coldblooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tvs the xfiles the aliens in contact seem to be like usthey are more curious than anything else they know we exist they want us to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly and between the characters ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey most of the film however takes place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens scientists are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leaders are wary and government officials are caught somewhere in between the debate is fueled largely by dr arroways atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankinds representative to another species the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches science and faith could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed still the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society the two sides are represented primarily by arroway and by farright fundamentalists but in reality probably 80 of americans are neither atheists nor farright fundamentalists palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a lessthanideal spokesman for any ideology then again the film does concentrate mostly on public debate which does after all tend to be dominated by extremists rather than on dinnertable or collegedormitory discussions contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself the films one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss for one thing it resorts to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction the romance rarely if ever sheds any light on the characters although it occasionally tries and fails josss explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement i guess you could say im a man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like a punchline to a joke than character development instead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments granted this is a plot and ideadriven film and the characters are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writers part more than anything else the successes of contact however far outweigh its failures even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didnt the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film contact doesnt quite cover all the bases but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a twohour film and its rejection of bigbudget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable and i would not be surprised if ten years from now contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction 
billy bob thornton who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer is becoming one of the most versatile and most accomplished american actors around at the moment as jacob the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxtons hank thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers three men hank paxton jacob thornton and their friend lou brent briscoe stumble upon a plane wreck which upon closer inspection yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money jacob and lou want to pocket the cash hank the smarter and perhaps more naive of the three insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find eventually they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found and then split the money three ways things start going wrong though with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan disaster is sure to strike director sam raimi of the evil dead and darkman fame has made an excellent and thoughtprovoking film worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come scott b smiths screenplay based on his novel which i havent read is a fine example of escalating tension while it does remind one of danny boyles shallow grave without the abundance of black humour it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality or the lack thereof found in a film with this subject matter alar kivilos cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coens fargo with the bleak snowy landscape almost becoming another character danny elfman also does well with his moody finelywritten score if theres a flaw in the film its that it goes on for just a little too long just when we think that they are about to wrap things up raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further while this isnt really a bad thing it did become a little frustrating at times this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand the performances are excellent with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scenestealing turn as hanks scheming wife this is an excellent showcase for thorntons fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films fingers crossed though that this doesnt stop him from making another evil dead sequel 
tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently the dalai lama has made speaking tours tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months kundun presence a name the monks call the young dalai lama opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader a group of monks enters a village and a twoyearold child catches their attention the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as mine he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 the peaceful and isolated country is illequipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india comparisons to seven years in tibet are inevitable both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerners point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt kundun features only native actors and is more of an insiders story in some ways this makes this film a superior concept but it lacks the movement and spark that made seven years such an audiencepleaser the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie filmed in morocco for obvious reasons the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computergenerated character on an intellectual level it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts some events are depicted differently and pitts austrian mountainclimber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lamas life isnt even mentioned here glossed over in seven years the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses we were just about to change things after the chinese attack the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain the visual treats more than make up for the movies faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience martin scorsese known for his dark tales of the underworld goodfellas taxi driver casino has shifted gears something of a thematic followup to his the last temptation of christ this is his slowest film yet oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese most of these events take place offscreen his decision to not overexplain rituals is commendable the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoonfed interpretations philip glasss score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india i was struck by what was missing in the movie as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is there is a distance between the audience and the movie the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings with the exception of a few scenes involvement with the characters is slight one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama shown as a mischievous boy who cant resist being a kid sometimes an encounter with his older brother thubten j norbu a retired indiana university professor who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment but there arent many of these even with its problems the kundun experience is phenomenal but one that i fear most will miss many people who saw seven years in tibet will have a been there done that attitude its likely that the film will miss a widespread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping 
i swear i have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film however the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot in doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence even horror films have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild was one of the best actionsuspense films i have seen from the 90s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day the edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall i must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around as in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely the edge is pretty much a survivalofthefittest film but taking screams lead the edge makes fun of the genres cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him for once we dont immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob as action films go these items do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect soon however bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his personality charles bob bobs assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and as shown in the previews hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter down the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film take for instance the entire manhunting bear plot this has been done many times in films with different animals and even bears but given the charles intelligence and bobs uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before my favorite line of the film comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isnt as it seems anymore i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely the first twothirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while thankfully we already have begun to care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and borders on phenomenal anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the doublenatured photographer elle macpherson gives a good performance albeit slight she isnt in the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as a model harold perrineau is a good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to but too many cliches bog it down director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts david mamets script though has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesnt end with the normal highstrung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift its a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear way to go bart 
one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made se7en is just a few steps away from brilliance however those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss the film received mixed reviews upon release but theres an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate payoff are excellent the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable this piece of work is 100 intensity its uncomfortable to watch yet compelling i want not to look yet i cannot turn away the story creeps along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien 3 se7en is even more ominous because the threat is real its human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credits ive ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development takes place morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt costars as detective david mills the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys these two fine actors give the film its human qualities along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who plays tracy mills wife however none of them stands out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset has only a week or 7 thats seven days left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins as chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found its the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking but i wont give that away as i said this has a great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the sinners suffer for it the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man they learn that he was murderedforced to eat himself to death the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and of course somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didnt it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see a lot of blood but its not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shownlike most of the violence in pulp fiction se7en is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is postdeath still if you tend to get queasy dont eat food during this film kevin spacey plays john doe the avenging angel who claims that hes the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings like many crazy men he has some fine ideas but some sick ways of expressing himself spacey doesnt appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesnt receive billing in the opening credits however its his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that its hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer has ever been so creative se7en is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and its often a little too depressing what it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue topnotch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive fincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we dont find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits which are run backwards up the screen its better to imagine what paths they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget its got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thingthe evils of the world arent going to cure themselves se7en raises some tough questions and its intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves useless triviacostars in 1995s se7en brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscarpitt in 12 monkeys spacey in the usual suspects for which he won 
there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original one of such masterpieces is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail at least judging by conventional moviemaking wisdom of its time it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadnt been produced on stage screenplay by three writers julius g epstein philip j epstein and howard koch was beeing written as shooting went along the main actors were producers second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz was considered to be capable but not great director however the movie was commercially successful and earned three oscars including the one for the best film until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in its own golden age the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story in december 1941 casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazicollaborating french vichy government thousands of refugees from wartorn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas many shady characters thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rains his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic antifascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple needs visas especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride selfpreserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status bogarts portrayal of rick as complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present was so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking some happier times when the romance on the screen didnt look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isnt the romance itself its the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choices in their life the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads the supporting actors also did a marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic john hustons maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaves little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rickilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime was embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rains managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rains also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renaults relationship towards rick and ricks final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations together with welldrawn characters and exciting story the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable if not realistic any way even if we dont see it as a historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration 
like the great musical pieces of mozart himself amadeus is a true work of art it is one of those few movies of the 80s that will be known for its class its style and its intelligence why is this such a good film there are almost too many reasons to explain the story court composer salieri f murray abraham feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart tom hulce comes into his life as the young genius composer salieri feels envy and jealousy but at the same time is fascinated with mozarts brilliance and ingenious we travel through mozarts life as a composer through his struggles his triumphs and ultimately his demise the acting abraham is magnificient as salieri his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language this performance earned him a well deserved oscar tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart a quirky annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh hes strong but weak at the same time and must be aided by his wife elizabeth berridge who is good in her role but lacks dramatic depth jeffrey jones in a smaller more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world is cast perfectly because of his noble charm the movie every element of this movie works the costumes and makeup are very memorable as well as its stunning art direction and unforgettable scores adapted from mozarts original music while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking this movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come ad2am i almost lost my nose and i like it i like breathing through it jack nicholson chinatown 
armageddon in itself symbolizes everything that is wrong in modern filmmaking stories have been replaced with special effects character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up armageddon is as stupid as loud and as shallow as any movie youll see come out this summer or maybe even any other summer but i loved every freaking minute of it believe me im just as shocked as you are hell i dont even know why i went to see it in the first place the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year or at least in the running im sorry but somebody dial 911 isnt quite the tagging thats going to sell a movie it isnt too wise either to market the film using the movies stupidest lines beam me up scotty yeah that sure is great writing i mean lets face it armageddons previews rival the truman shows as being some of the worst of the year neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice of course you all know the story when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas nasa calls in the uss top oil drillers to go into space and implant a nuclear device eighthundred and someodd feet into the asteroid in the coarse of all this mayhem we are introduced to some interesting and not so interesting characters belonging to the former group is rockhound steve buscemi a horny little womanizing genius whos always full of wisecracks even when flying into space at a huge amount of gs also theres the always coolashell billy bob thornton as dan truman the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 only without the intensity and great lines to deliver then on the flip side of the coin is the tired contrived character of harry stamper bruce willis who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i cant quite place the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie basically thats about it as i said this is hardly a film about plot its another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden case in point nasa doesnt know that there is even an asteroid on its way until eighteen days before impact huh another example at one point in the movie two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy how pretentious is that want another one okay before the oil drillers blast off into space one of them starts singing leaving on a jet plane and soon all the rest join in did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture but naturally all this sappiness melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies and dont get me wrong despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon i still very much enjoyed it so even if you dont win one of mcdonalds free tickets its still definitely worth checking out 
this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywoods most famous celebrities some fabulous animation and a compelling story this is the best weve seen from disney since beauty and the beast 1996 this film begins an unspecified time following the happilyeverafter conclusion to toy story in the aftermath of their earlier adventures buzz voice of tim allen and woody voice of tom hanks are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony content with their lives one day andy broke woodys arm off while playing with him woody is now officially discarged and worthless left with his nightmares where he lies in a trash can with the other discards later andys mother decides to have a yard sale and she collects a few old toys from her sons room since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang woody goes to the rescue leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back although his mission is successful he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al voice of wayne knight spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series woodys roundup if he can acquire woody al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit so after andys mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy al steals him and its up to the other toys led by buzz to go into the city to save their friend and so buzz rex voice of wallace shawn hamm voice of john ratzenberger mr potatohead voice of don rickles and slinky voice of jim varney go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys there are car chases gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis who by the way resembles darth vader meanwhile woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family a cowgirl named jessie voice of joan cusack a horse named bullseye and a father figure called the prospector voice of kelsey grammar they offer him another life as a celebrity a toy in a museum in japan he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while before he grows up and be forgotten or be admired by children for generations the problem is if woody escapes from als clutches and returns home they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage a real effort is made in the technical department the animation is rich and colorful with lots of wonderful details the cinematography is also extremely improved since toy story there are a lot of complicated swings turns and closeups that really make an impression lighting and filters are used to create a mood as in a surprisingly emotional moment jessies remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy the film contains a lot of inside jokes such as the one about videogames and entertaining parodies on jurassic park and star wars the film ends with the failed takes the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film but what in the end makes toy story 2 a memorable experience is not the jokes its multiple parodies or marvelous animation it is its heart and emotions the story about the meaning of friendship love and even life itself it is not difficult to predict that toy story 2 would be a huge economical success but its artistic achievement was unexpected unexpected because the first film wasnt much more than a demonstration of special effects but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasnt produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years this is a big stepaway from the ancient laws of disneyanimation off course this is not antz it is not as intelligent this is not a landmark and no masterpiece but i promise that youll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have whether this is the best animated film of the year i dare not say my choice would probably be the iron giant but along side with american pie this is the comedy of the year i almost lost my hopes for disney but toy story 2 proves that disney hasnt lost their ability to entertain 
not too many people know who james whale is but its a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies if we are to believe the semi biographical gods and monsters whale would have wanted it to be that way this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whales life because it tracks only the final few days of his life and its probably a better movie for it its focus is on whales ian mckellen untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone brendan fraser it begins with whale a fairly talented artist aside from being a director asking boone to sit for him pose for a portrait at first boone doesnt realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man when he does discover whales sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid lynn redgrave he is frightened refusing to sit for the guy but he comes back only to storm out again disgusted with whales locker room talk boone returns yet another time after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned locker room talk and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening meanwhile jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago his ailment leads to desperation and depression which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan frasers bravura performance up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in blast from the past for example i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here this is impressive because his characters dialogue is minimal with mckellan doing most of the talking that requires fraser to act through body language a difficult skill to master but something he proves capable of doing well this is not to ignore mckellans oscar nominated turn he earned that nomination with his touching performance here although at the risk of sounding like a philistine i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination an understated compelling gem whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield he rejoiced in being free from it only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people in the end perhaps it is what killed him the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare 1999 eugene novikov137 
when i initially set out to review this film my tag line was going to be you too can believe whales can fly then it was going to be you too can believe pastel triangles can fly then it was going to be you too can believe wood sprites can fly finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say theres a lot of flying going on in this film as our first host steve martin tells us the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 grossing somewhere close to 110 000 in its original month of release subsequent rereleases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six stories high in an exclusive four month engagement from january 1st to april 30th 2000 fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theaters is the format effective for the film with a few exceptions yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethovens fifth symphony its hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil black batlike triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts eventually shafts of light from above help drive away the evil batlike things and peace returns to the butterfly things though this segment isnt very story driven some of the images are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things who are all outlined in blood red colors begin to overtake the skies the next segment is set to ottorino respighis the pines of rome in this segment some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the oceans of clouds again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whales are involved reportedly the whales as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences are shown as actual size the cgi whales look incredibly lifelike except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segments is set to george gershwins rhapsody in blue this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york theres a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer an outofwork sad sack that dreams of having a job a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife i wont go into how everything works out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments segment four is set to dmitri shostakovichs piano concerto no 2 and is an animated version of hans christian andersens the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a windup clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he cant see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jackinthebox jester the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little does the jester know the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl although the ending has been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some children may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saintsaens the carnival of the animals this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yoyo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia and its the one that people remember most the sorcerers apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasnt made to be presented on large format film considering it was shot full frame and exhibits large amounts of grain there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many 18plus screen theaters segment seven is set to sir edward elgars pomp and circumstance march no 1 and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck stars as an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didnt make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tearjerkers foisted on audiences these days powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinskys the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path including everything that the sprite has worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segments are largely no pun intended throwaways although steve martins clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment comes from of all people bette midler who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board pieces like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horsemen set to wagners ride of the valkyries and a strange segment prepared in the 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments for fans of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material as i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whalestriangle thingssprites can fly g 
its tough to really say something nice about a type of person whos so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history x does it and for that i commend it it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neonazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone whos not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack hes the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks hes so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and hes played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks hes almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as say malcom x when we first see him hes clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast a devlish goatee and hes attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets at least when he doesnt need them he so believes in his convictions that hes willing to put his beliefs to the test even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison if only for a couple years american history x is about derek how he became a neonazi skinhead how he rose to power how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stages as a smart teenager a vicious hate monger a man having an epiphany and the man who tries to correct what hes done before and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all sides or at least thats the intention the films framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about 13 also now a skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brooks who i just found out was or is the captain on star treks deep space 9 is trying to correct him when the film opens danny has just written a book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which causes him to make him write a paper on dereks life and how it has gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him hes cleanedup not as buff and has a full head of hair hes just as intelligent but still very rough along the edges but hes wisened up hes no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews and tries to persuade danny whos becoming what derek was before to give up his lifestyle but danny wont he goes to a large skinhead beer bash meets with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neonazidom as he was for it a couple of years ago the film circles around this then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks all done in black and white we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasisadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white middleclass teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on to them the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he backs everything up with political reasons justifying their rage at least to them and frighteningly enough much of what he says sounds true american history x is a collection of really great scenes and moments rather than a cohesive great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scenes ive seen all year one scene features a dinner between dereks family and his mothers newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with dereks rightist views launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience goulds reaction to dereks final summation is unnerrving another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black coworker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soontobeclassic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year theres much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with standouts coming from avery brooks beverly dangelo as the longsuffering mother and gould who has one horrible line but other than that comes off with the best performance hes given in what seems like a really long time norton walks off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation and maybe the best theres nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing sadly enough this isnt going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be its too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movies tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the fat skinhead whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isnt as well travelled furlongs danny never seems to really be learning a lesson since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make a change by the end which was inevitable it doesnt seem like it has actually arrived there even dereks descent into skinheaddom doesnt seem justified though his fireman father william russ the dad from boy meets world and dont ask me how i know that is killed by a black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs as such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed sorta american history x is a very good movie and i was very moved by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential somewhere he claims there lies a tony kaye cut and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director it wasnt allowed to him under the grounds that once you disown a film you can not badmouth it but really thats the macguffin no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kayes right in that its not up to par even if hes not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be a do the right thing for the late 90s yet it still gets its point across intelligently and backs it up with its story its message that one cannot be so enwrapped in ones own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it isnt perfect at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything hes done has made his life any better it realy hits a nerve not only in derek but also in the audience 
synopsis as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case if she can survive the demanding s e a l training she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps throw in a lot of political machinations sabotage brutality water and sand and you have an entertaining movie review the title of this movie turned me off at first i mean gi jane the other titles which were considered were more promising in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as im concerned i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie moore as lieutenant jordan oneil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men the storyline is simple anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless machiavellian politician with an agenda to push using feminism to achieve political mileage she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s e a l training jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all looks brains and strength the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch nonetheless its one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless heroheroine along in hisher endeavours sure there are the stereotypical elements inhuman treatment sexual innuendo resentful peers pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer stepping away from the stereotypes though viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character jordans boyfriend royce is also in the military although they both started at the same time due to the fact that he has seen active service he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has royce what is his surname do we care almost resents jordans attempts to advance herself although he quickly settles down to being doeeyed and supportive his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you dont have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military in parts this is a very silly movie with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that its hard not to cringe i still liked it though weaknesses in the script aside this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood as we watch jordans battle its increasingly clear that it is a personal battle this is an individuals fight for selfadvancement we dont have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings we dont have to feel uncomfortable because were having ideology thrust down our throats its enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not 
the idea at the center of the devils advocate which is thus far one of the three or four best films of 1997 is that no matter what decision is made evil will triumph god is a trickster satan is a humanist the last humanist he appears in many guises and seduces many men and women in his own words vanity by far my favorite sin al pacino plays this role with relish and gets to chew some delectable lines lemme givya a piece o inside wisdom on god i have a million names as john milton the devil the main idea that he can appear as anyone in any form in this case a buisness man harkens mainly back to terry gilliams the time bandits but the film is something else something original part of what makes it so very good is that it never takes itself too seriously it dabbles with morality vanity death and child abuse but doesnt try to become any profound study of power this is a marvelous confection cocky funny thought provoking it is also entertaining there is no way you could possibly predict the ending it pulls back upon itself drawing purely out of the minds eye the final shot is more creative more daring more challenging then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coens fargo the central themes are fascinating sometimes reminiscent of james the turn of the screw and oates accursed inhabitants of the house of bly and the product that is built around it really wows its nice to know that things like this are still being made 
scream 2 like its predecessor is a genrecrossing film it is about 50 horror film and 50 murder mystery the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time scream was also known for its selfreferential tone many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven again scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as sequels suck and the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels scream 2s story is very similar to its predecessors sidney neve campbell having survived the killing spree in scream is now in college gale weathers courteney cox has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film called stab which for all practical purposes is the realworld movie scream at the premiere of stab two students from sidneys college are stabbed to death and a new story begins the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer they want to know all about the links between stab sidney and the recent murders the most complex selfreference i saw this should be an olympic event was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press the audience was watching the whole filmed scene whew the movie is packed with layers and selfreferences that make it a pleasure to watch even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 thats not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep or even a good movie the just add to the fun of watching it i recommend it for other reasons as well what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible it is a person in a mask and a robe his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies you have less grounds to say its just a movie the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself gale weathers and deputy dewey david arquette also from the original track down a killer they are likeable but not outstanding but in combination with the horror aspect the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works so i wonder if ill be doing the same thing on january 1 1999 if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high ill be happy to mark my calendar 
when i first saw the previews for ron howards latest film my expectations were discouragingly low a show about nothing sounds like seinfeld a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day sounds like the truman show what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants another puts one out about bugs which is why i was pleasantly surprised by edtv which turns out to be a fresh insightful and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity the writing by howards longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus in the hands of a lessexperienced director edtv could easily have had all the flavor of yesterdays meatloaf with their true tv cable ratings being threatened by the gardening channel apparently people would rather watch soil the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers program director cynthia topping ellen degeneres comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment the hook is to find a regular guy someone normal that people can relate to while scouting possible candidates cynthias camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray woody harrelson in a bar where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame but on watching the videotape the shows producers are more taken with ed than with ray hes cute he says all the wrong things and hes 100 usda hick cynthias boss played by rob reiner gives the show a week to deliver the goods and its tough going in the early stages the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth action shot wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster you get the idea but soon enough thingsnielsenboosting kinds of thingsstart to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the true tv cameras are right there to document it eds privacy is no longer his own his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media who should ed go out with you can be sure the pollsters have a list not only is the film exceedingly well cast but its performers are consistently excellent matthew mcconaughey provides the face the body language and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of americas latest phenomenon he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as eds mother and martin landau is one of the films highlights as al eds ailing stepfather jenna elfman from tvs dharma and greg proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting even degeneres and reiner are better than youd expect in 1979 writerdirectorcomedian albert brooks made a zany little film called real life in which a smalltime opportunist makes a realtime documentary about a typical american family the scenes of eds family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a bigbudget variant on that film paralleling its wickedly inventive humor as with most films by albert brooks real life was funny but absurd the funniestand scariestthing about edtv is that it is absolutely believable

it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a lessthansavoury character as mel gibson does in payback of course if i was being paid 25 million for one months work id probably be willing to take risks as well but thats neither here nor there payback is based on a novel by richard stark apparently actually donald e westlake author of the grifters itself a fine crime film which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys lee marvin the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back by whom we dont know yet all we know is that gibson as porter isnt a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back and getting even in the process no matter what the consequences it turns out that the man hes after is val gregg henry his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers porter however is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet goes about exacting revenge on the doublecrossing val gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesnt mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants you probably wouldnt see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat outofcharacter role such as porter jim carrey wont be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried the cable guy anyone harrison fords idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin which we wont mention further and has stallone ever really played a villain at all this is not to say that porter is a villain per se while he isnt the sort of character you wouldnt want to get on the wrong side of hes nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their righthand men just to prove how mean they are porter is only trying to get back what is notsorightfully his which in a way is almost understandable payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedythriller which wont be remembered as being among gibsons most important work but is still one of the finer films hes done the only real problem with it is that while everything seems to work out in the end i was left feeling something was lacking was that all the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute and the final voiceover doesnt ring true even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the filmnoir style the rest of the film embodies the film just ends far too suddenly after a huge buildup in the penultimate scenes a fine film even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending 
if you thought baz luhrmanns radical take on williamshakespearesromeojuliet was wild wait until what you see what tony awardwinning stage director julie taymor thelionking thebroadwaymusical does to the bards titusandronicus for her audaciousand very bloodyfilm debut while luhrmann transplanted the starcrossed lovers to 1990s florida taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in romebut places it in a surreal temporal limbo the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more 40s and 50s and other garments are more gladiatorlike as tamora queen of goths jessica lange exacts revenge on roman general titus anthony hopkins for killing her eldest son and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the storys underlying themes however the time convergence approach only works at times for often its just distracting as in one scene where tamoras suviving sons matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers blow off steam playing video arcade games taymor didnt have to resort to such avant garde time tricks for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist the latter compliment encompassing all areas makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments she also has a sure way with actors hopkins titus is at once tragic and horrifying and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora the clear standout of the cast however is harry lennix as aaron a moor who is tamoras secret lover and a schemer in his own right lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain a great villain he indeed is but to leave it at that isnt giving full justice to his powerful and multidimensional work titus isnt a complete success but it is never less than fascinating and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice 
meteor threat set to blow away all volcanoes twisters summer is here again this season could probably be the most ambitious season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact godzilla the xfiles armageddon the truman show all of which has but one main aim to rock the box office leading the pack this summer is deep impact one of the first few film releases from the spielbergkatzenberggeffens dreamworks production company following the rather dismal showing of their previous two releases mousehunt and amistad deep impact shines with elements which could just make it one of the biggest movies of the year deep impact begins with the discovery of an earth bound comet during a school astronomy outing by leo beiderman elijah wood which subsequently stirred up the political community of the world keeping the information under wraps to prevent widespread panic president beck morgan freeman took it upon himself and his subordinates to execute a highly secretive space project to destroy the comet before it hits earth while pursuing a sexscandal story amongst the presidential ranks ambitious up and coming reporter jenny lerner tea leoni unfolds the wool that president beck has pulled over the citizens of the world as if the knowledge of the imminent annihilation of mankind is not enough jenny has to come to terms with her father maximillian schell leaving the mother for a younger woman 20 president beck announces the discovery and preparations to destroy the comet exactly oneyear later with so much confidence that it left no trace of panic within the american community achieving fame from announcement of the comet wolfbeiderman enroute to earth the name of its discoverers leo beiderman continues life in his small town as a young celebrity a team of astronauts led by the ageing veteran astronaut spurgeon tanner robert duvall was secretly trained to carry out the mission to land on the comet and create and explosion with a nuclear device with the hope of blowing it out of its current path towards earth despite him being the most experienced in the team the younger generation of astronauts in the team doubts tanners ability due to his age but these are just problems of individuals life on earth goes on as any other day confident that the comet will be destroyed when the attempt to avert wolfbeidermans path failed and caused the comet to split into two comet wolf and comet beiderman the president unfolds his contingency plan to evacuate part of the population leaving the rest to die citizens are randomly chosen to live underground for 2 years prior to impact when the dust due to the impact around earth have settled by then all life on the surface would have died jenny and leo were picked but many of their loved ones were not only a handful of earths population will be saved from destruction 20 deep impacts moving moments occur in the least specialeffect laced scenes while the effects are fantastic they only form a small part of the film which indulges itself in the development of its main characters leo lerner and tanner leos struggle when he learns that his girlfriend is not part of the population to be saved lerners dwindling relationship with her father and her pain for the mothers loneliness tanners strive to gain the respect he deserves from his crew and his ultimate sacrifice all form the backbone of deep impacts moving moments deep impact smells suspiciously like the previous year release contact despite vivid differences i think its probably because they both delve in a story of global proportions and indulges in the premise of hope faith and life itself both do not depend heavily on eyecandy in the form of cgi effects director mimi leder who won numerous awards directing television series and made her debut with peacekeeper last year is definitely a director to watch 20 despite this being the first of the two meteor movies this summer the other being armageddon i think there will be stark differences in the approach to the subject matter while the premise of both may be the same execution and focus of the films will in fact show that deep impact has more focus on human elements than armageddon which is done by the team which brought us bad boys crimson tide and the rock 20 deep impact should be able to satisfy a variety of audiences from the most actioncraving to those who just want to immerse into its manipulative but nonetheless dramatic premise 
there is a striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach to watch the sun rise the camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in black then the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played by nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up you see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they cannot feel a human touch it is an important scene for several reasons first of all it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible the film presents these fantastic beings as normallooking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on with little interference there are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield 1994 or michael 1996 the angels here are stark and believable this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how gods angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well they eternally walk the earth listening to our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying to heaven like human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure city of angels is essentially a love story between seth and a human a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan he first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven maggie is distraught doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved by her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can with his invisible touch but its not enough he wants to be with her and share her pain not just stand back at a distance he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to fall and become human he learns this from another fallen angel played by dennis franz n y p d blue in a touching and humorous performance sitting at a diner together franz tells cages character about how wonderful it is to be human to be able to taste food feel another persons skin smell the air and most importantly have a loving wife and children of course there is pain to go along with all this but for seth it will be worth it city of angels is something of a reinterpretation of wim wenders haunting 1988 film wings of desire wenders film was more like a poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human and unlike most foreign films that are remade into hollywood fare it doesnt suffer extensive damage this may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted to make city of angels its own movie inspired by wings of desire but not an attempt to copy it and yet city of angels is not a typical hollywood movie it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world seale creates many striking visuals in addition to the beach scene there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by while the film travels along a charted plot it takes time to develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are both cage and ryan give soulful softspoken performances ryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks with the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have what is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay which is both unexpected and challenging its not a formulaic hollywood ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time it doesnt give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance instead it offers something much better something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive visit charlie dont surf an eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http www bigfoot comjimkendrick email jimkendrickbigfoot com 
star wars episode 1 the phantom menace 1999 review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas 1977 classic star wars the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more americans today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so 22 years after the release of the original and 16 years since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icons against this challenge the fourth star wars film episode one the phantom menace hit the screens last week and despite some early critical reviews in the major media the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star wars films the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films as the film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor quigon jinn liam neeson the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboos young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battledamaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine quigon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the parts they need but displays uncanny intelligence insight and instincts quigon senses the child is unusually strong with the force and begins to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows far from being a galactic savior the innocentlooking 9yearold will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sounds a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knights anakins turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story moves quickly with the only drawback being that many questions predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reasons the films story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused its unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movies were clearly lukes story with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but its unclear whether this new film is anakins story or obiwans if this trilogy is centered on anakin its a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers and as a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littleboy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that quigon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast does fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight mcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fits the role of a young queen well but her lines were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters but the interaction between them individually the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesnt do as good of a job playing the characters off one another in star wars there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han han and obiwan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other individually they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful elements of lucas previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the characters visit magical underwater cities evade dinosaursized sea monsters fight battle droids and menacing destroyers on venetianlooking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part romanchariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings he creates rich spectacular landscapes palaces and skylines most of the new special effects in his rereleased special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just werent possible when the films were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures robots with personalities and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room of all the computergenerated characters in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computergenerated characters no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than 80 minutes of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computergenerated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jons accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comicrelief role in the film lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors however despite the technological magic that makes his character possible jar jar isnt completely convincing he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that hes there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar was a lot of fun and i didnt mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the films struggles between good and evil and the sober musings about ones destiny and the force like all star wars films the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasnt lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a oneman twoheaded announcer team calling the action at the films thrilling podrace sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lots of halfhidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace works because as in all his films there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are lightsaber battles hairraising chases and thrilling duels between good and evil the podrace sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film and the final showdown between obiwan quigon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed the phantom menace wont win any major oscars it probably wont beat titanics box office record and its not even the best star wars film id put it third after the original and the empire strikes back but its an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film cant live up to its hype no film not even the original star wars could have done that but its still worth seeing probably more than once 
the premise is simple if not bizarre a mad scientist trace beaulieu as dr clayton forrester launches an averagejoe michael j nelson as mike nelson into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made why its torturous its maniacal and its just plain fun based on the cultfavorite cable television series mystery science theater 3000 the movie isnt torturous but as for being maniacal and just plain fun it foots the bill quite nicely mike nelson on a dogbone shaped spacecraft spends his days as any young man would dream indulging in sarcasm and horseplay and seeing quite a few movies the catch is these movies arent the movies he chooses but retched examples of filmmaking chosen specifically by dr forrester in an attempt to break mikes will to live dr forrester is convinced that one too many b movies is all it will take to ruin a man but with a couple of wisecracking puppet buddies tom servo voiced by kevin murphy and crow t robot voiced by beaulieu the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known even if by very few of us to man we watch as the silhouettes of mike tom and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them in this case its the 1954 scifi film this island earth we basically watch as our three leads watch only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant but for the sake of those who might want to know ill explain this one this island earth is the tale of two scientists a man and a woman who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet to make mst3k work the filmwithinthefilm naturally has to be as horrible as possible and although the tvseries introduced us to several worse films than this island earth its a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty mst3k which doesnt actually contain the complete this island earth is a short 73 minutes but this is a step very wisely taken as funny as some of their observations are it can only go so long occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment its better than overkilling the whole concept post haste mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly but if you dont know what youre in for it could be a jarring disappointment although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars it is a movie to be seen on home video late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway and with a large saracastic crowd new years at midnight for example which is when i saw it warning although mst3k has more to its end credits than most the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun they are actually more annoying than most the name slandering and asinine oneliners were extremely unfunny and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight it put a heavy damper on the overall experience most people will likely stay to see what the smartalecs have to say but for me it almost ruined an otherwise good film 
any movie about the underground music scene is a difficult beast to master any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbingdown of the experience to make it more accessible to the general public or the film is produced and directed by people that have about enough understanding of the subject matter that they ought to work as production assistants for vh1 human traffic a new film exploring the british underground partyrave scene and the people immersed in the world of clubbing pubbing drugs sex and the beautiful beautiful music is an example of how it really ought to be done the film follows five brits in their young twenties during a wild weekend of parties drugs dancing sex pop culture discussions relationships and wanking off in front of a mirror while mum interrupts the cast of character consists of jip john simm our narrator who has a bit of a problem with his willy known as mr floppy koop shaun parkes our black dj maestro who has insecurity issues afraid his girlfriend nina nicola reynolds is shagging other men nina herself cant stand her mcjob and longs for the freedom of the weekends lulu lorraine pilkington jips best mate is tired of her cheating boyfriends and moff danny dyer cant seem to escape the black hole of his awful life the film follows these five individuals during one weekend as each of them discovers love friendship and selffulfillment all against the raging party background human traffic is proof that cinema can still tell us deep stories while being visually alive as director justin kerrigans subtle use of the camera lets the audience become part of the action the use of direct communication to the audience by the collection of characters works well making the viewer the subconscious mind for the characters dialogue is crisp and moves with an even pace and the acting is confident however the two females leads tend to promote their relationships and dialogue with a bit of unneeded urgency that shows through when poignancy is needed human traffic does not try to explain the rave scene instead it gives the audience the ability to listen to the people inside it letting you choose your own convictions about this powerful musical movement that brings together strangers friends and lovers for one blissful night of music and peace

how many of us would become strippers for those of us who wouldnt is it a moral reason or purely a lack of confidence thats probably not a fair question and for a lot of us it could very well be for neither of those reasons as you watch the full monty however you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough in case you havent guessed the full monty is about stripping but striptease it aint its actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication it is the story of six outofwork outofshape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless but not without need what to do it hits our main character gaz robert carlyle as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis it seems that simple take it off and bring in the cash eventually gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance these include the overweight confidencelacking dave mark addy the uptight overlyofficious gerald tom wilkinson the once suicidal lomper steve huison and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition horse paul barber an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy and guy hugo speer a young wellendowed looker who compares himself to cary grant when the sextet is complete were given a hefty dose of physical comedy we watch the bumbling middleaged men choreograph pseudosexy dance numbers all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place as if there antiappeal wasnt enough they decide to boost interest in the group by promising the full monty on opening night which for us americans means baring it all and i mean all the movie actually ends on opening night a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add its sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater with the subject matter you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feelgood almost inspiring film but it surprisingly turns out that way the amount of light touching drama also comes as a nice surprise never feeling offbalance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film theres a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words and the ensemble cast couldnt be better each character is completely individual interesting funny and most importantly real the full monty is never offensive a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone couldve easily fallen prey to tastelessness its one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment perfect for a great night on the town or as a saturday night movie rental either way you see it it shouldnt let you down in the slightest and pun heavily intended when its all said and done youll be smiling from cheek to cheek 
director dominic sena who made the highly underrated kalifornia and producer jerry bruckheimer the rock armageddon bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen nicolas cage plays memphis a retired car thief whos pulled back in to the business by an evil car thief overlord christopher eccleston determined to kill memphis kid brother giovanni ribisi memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang memphis sets out to put his old crew back together but discovers that most of them have retired as well gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits in that sequence we get a rockin little tune from moby along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride and what follows doesnt disappoint cage turns in one of his good performances here he can easily go either way good or bad i dont know how he does that and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely of the supporting cast members angelina jolie as memphis former love is in the film just to provide eye candy shes definitely the hottest looking grease monkey ive ever seen and robert duvall as memphis former mentor is just around to lend the film some class also im a big fan of will patton armageddon the postman and would love to see him get a huge role someday none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles delroy lindo get shorty shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis as does timothy olyphant go as lindos partner i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll theres no doubt in anyones mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the rival car thief plot line as it stands that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package but if i was making this film id have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew thereby making memphis have to improvise thereby adding some meat to the plot the finale is essentially just a big car chase and there just arent ways to make car chases interesting anymore its all been done the chase is also shot and edited in that jerry bruckheimer action sequence kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene sure its a car chase but what exactly are the particulars of it its very hard to tell finally theres a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the bus jumping the ramp sequence from speed in the oh i dont think so department despite those minor complaints gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment its not thought provoking but its shiny loud and fun just what a summer flick should be pg13 
books could be and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy and rightfully so this is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70searly 80s inspiring literally dozens of clones from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre the special effects were groundbreaking revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it and now george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterdays star wars updated with todays special effects wizardry either way the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen where it rightfully deserves to be seen can there be anyone in the world who doesnt know what star wars is about in a way star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it its a story about a young mans coming of age a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire a tale of swashbuckling and derringdo the likes of which havent been seen on the silver screen in decades strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world its high adventure incredible special effects and well its just an experience something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation and its about to do so again this new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the films devoted fans who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now interviews trailers leaks from within lucasfilm all of these have been collected collated and placed on webpages for people to see pages such as http www islandnet comcoronafilmsdetailssw4 html or my personal favorite http leopard cs latrobe edu aukoukoula pictures of before and after have been placed side by side even months before the movies were released fans were making comparisons in some cases the changes were nothing less than phenomenal and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original for instance in my personal favorite example the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep mosscovered carvings and etchings and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling booming city with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing all the starships and fighters are now computeranimated getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally madeand they look fantastic four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldnt do it justice however much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself the negatives badly damaged by the ravages of time were brightened and returned to their original splendor the audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt into glorious booming theatershaking fullthx dolby digital stereo and that more than the added scenes or new special effects is where the real value of this new version lies its really true what they say in the commercials star wars loses so much on the small screen even letterboxing doesnt make up for the decrease in size and definition in regard to the star wars special edition and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released ill make this final recommendation go and see it go and see it more than once it may be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after its gone this time take along the youngsters whove never had the bigscreen star wars experienceyoull enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time theres magic in this moviespecial edition or no there can be no denying that its still star wars and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages from four to four hundred lets all return to that time long ago and that galaxy far far away 
eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career known for his notorious late 80s slump murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years with the exception of the dreadful holy man he appears to be on pace for a fullfledged comeback life was a great move on the part of murphy and costar martin lawrence because its a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slapsticky drivel director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own and doesnt insert a distracting plot to back them up life is in a sense one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other amazingly the scale never tips in eithers favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other as the movie opens were introduced to ray gibson eddie murphy a twotiming pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club there he meets a successful businessman named claude banks martin lawrence somehow after multiple contrivances the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run when all is said and done ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff hence the setting of life mississippi state prison where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important and become set on finding an foolproof escape plan the film takes us from the 30s all the way to the 90s presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude luckily rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic academy award caliber manner not only do we believe the characters look as if theyre 90 years old but they sound like it too murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up its sleeve while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at its core but the comedic aspects work wonderfully wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama but in both senses its an overwhelming delight i could say a few bad things about the movie but i dont want to its such a nice surprise such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll 
cinematically speaking gordon parks original 1971 shaft is not a great film a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidymans black private dick thats a sex machine to all the chicks to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly 30 years after its original releaseand long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decadethe 1971 shaft remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the films connection with moviegoers far beyond the target africanamerican audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broadbased appeal stems from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass this fact also explains why john singletons y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is much like the film that started the franchise this shafts plot doesnt score points in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers contrary to what has been reported over the past few months this shaft is not a remake of the original film but more of a sequelspinoff the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels 1972s shaftsbigscore and 1973s shaftinafrica richard roundtree once again plays john shaft who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the film lies on his samenamed nephew samuel l jackson who as the film begins is a cop whose takenocrap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors when a privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of a brutal raciallymotivated murder is allowed to be released on bail a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p i but thats easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez jeffrey wright a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime peoplesor rather wright is also the big obstacle in jacksons way toward commanding this film peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stages however he isnt so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming its no easy task to steal a film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but thats exactly what wright doesand makes it seem effortless then again with such a talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jacksons impressive star turn doesnt quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other costars bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in americanpsycho so it only follows that his performance as a similar less exaggerated character would be spoton collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened conflicted diane busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shafts sidekick rasaan registering not as stronglybut through no fault of their ownare vanessa williams as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez and a dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also has little to do in a sense some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside his shaft doesnt even have one sex scene that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since hes not really an action director this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases they move well as does the film as a whole and are reasonably exciting its just that theres nothing terribly inventive about them these set pieces are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but theyre unsurprising and conventional but if theres anything that a shaft movie does well its make the familiar look cooland this shaft keeps that tradition alive from the slick title sequencescored of course to isaac hayes everinfectious oscarwinning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the filmon the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced it feels necessary style doesnt exactly make for a great film but when it comes to shaft thats of little consequence what matters above all else is having a good time and the latest shaft should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad muthashut your mouth 
uncompromising french director robert bressons lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malorys morte darthur instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them chivalry has no place in lancelot of the lake except as that of a dying ideal bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlins command to retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that was filled with christs blood bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure the opening sequence is a series of clumsy disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights a head is hacked off a stomach is impaled a skull is split open skeletal remains hang from trees and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house since the film starts with camelot in nearruin and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion it doesnt carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian films we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power therefore there is no real downfall to witness but then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film rather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of a kingdom lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh the greatest of all knights he was flawed only in his love for arthurs wife queen guinevere and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere laura duke condominas he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion when sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knights including sir gawain humbert balsan spring to lancelots defense it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh wins out over the spirit and the consequences are dire bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of mens hearts and minds lancelot of the lake is filled with his particular trademarks a strippeddown minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music he uses background music only twice in the film during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the films thematic elements the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horses the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest like most of his other films bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voices all the actors he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and with the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word instead of using vocal inflection bresson strove to create emotion through images in some ways this technique works in other ways it doesnt the final montage of arthurs men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrappile sums up the entire film in one moment however other times bressons uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable for instance during an important jousting contest bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses legs he does this repeatedly opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag while there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome nevertheless lancelot of the lake is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker bressons style may not be for everyone but one has to respect his strength as an artist by reevaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own he turns lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema a truly personal film 
capsule the best place to start if youre a jackie chan newcomer roars along never stops for breath and frequently hilarious to talk about jackie chan as a stuntman is to miss a million things jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today but also a very funny guy he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger used to make me laugh hes funny just standing there copping a look supercop has jackie making us laugh scream duck root and gasp for breath often all in the same scene its actually the third in a loosely related series of movies each with jackie playing kevin chan a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neckdeep into trouble and then karatekicking his way out of it the others are also worth seeing its a little slow to start but once it gets moving its a field day the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china which requires him to collaborate with the attractive and asskicking chief fo chinese security played here by the everenjoyable michelle yeoh theres a fun chemistry between the two of them especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail all undercover of course and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss the drug boss however has problems of his own his wifes on trial for many of his own crimes and shes got the key to an account with all of his drug funds this means of course endless trouble not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while hes out in the field and she sees him with this other woman and but thats one of the movies unique pleasures the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly action there is of course nonstop action in this movie everything from oneonone kung fu to allout gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines outrunning the hong kong coast guard there is also a virtuoso climax which features among other things jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter a wrongway freeway chase which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the copter as well as a motorcycle you get the idea this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food quick enjoyable filling watch it with friends when they stop making movies like this the world will be a tad greyer 
the calendar year has not even reached its midway point but that hasnt prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscarbait season bille augusts highprofile adaptation of victor hugos classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epichandsome production values strong performances by a topnotch cast a literate screenplaywith one critically missing element emotional sweep for those not familiar with hugos original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19thcentury frenchset version of the fugitive after serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread the brutish jean valjean liam neeson is paroled immediately upon release he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night he is caught by authorities only to be forgiven by the bishop who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow that he does and in doing so breaks his parole which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert geoffrey rush who was one of the guards in valjeans prison camp on his trail thematically however les miserables is a story about redemption which valjean finds through his dealings with two women the hardluck factoryworkerturnedprostitute fantine uma thurman and her illegitimate daughter cosette years after breaking parole valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert valjean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette mimi newman from her cruel caretakers the thenardiers and raise the child as his own the father and daughter eventually land in paris where the teenage cosette claire danes falls for dashing student revolutionary marius hans matheson the decadesspanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of and the danish august turns in his most accomplished englishlanguage work following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last years stylish but highly preposterous mystery smillas sense of snow he and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace production designer anna asp costume designer gabriella pescucci and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable rushs finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated oscarwinning theatrics in shine and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role the younger members of the cast fare less well danes is convincing as cosette but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction and matheson while competent is a less interesting robert sean leonard as technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is by the time les miserables was over my emotions had only been superficially involved while i was touched by valjeans relationships with fantine and cosette i was not moved not even reaching the touching level is the cosettemarius pairing my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical as i am sure many others is and i was dismayed to see eponine a friend of mariuss who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation the daughter of the thenardiers here she is only briefly seen as a child her presence would have added some muchneeded conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine fantine was enough even so as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season les miserables is a thoughtful wellmade entertaining film one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn nobrainers invade the multiplex 
an entertaining 2 hours awaits the audience in this film set in the early 80s sevigny and beckinsale play disco chicks alice and charlotte who are on the lookout for love alice is mousy shy intellectual charlotte is bitchy outgoing and fun we join their adventures as they go through a variety of adventures and men all to the background of the local disco whit stillman has both written and directed an interesting and believable story alice and charlotte are both well written characters and the actresses who play them arent bad aswell sevigny delivers an honest performance and makes the audience feel for her character beckinsale plays extreme bitch personified yet her character never becomes completely unlikeable the huge supporting cast also play a part in making sure this movie is thoroughly entertaining the dialogue is sharp and well written with many funny set pieces for example theres a great discussion about lady the tramp by the main characters the disco tunes playing in the background also make sure that this admittedly long film is good fun the direction is good bringing out the drama and comedy in the scenes but their are slight flaws with the movie firstly although it is supposedly set in the 80s the characters are very very 90s the way they dress and act have a very 90s feel to them although the male hairstyles look slightly 80s frankly the 80s atmosphere just wasnt conveyed which is a shame also as mentioned above the film is too long and some parts do lag the charm of the characters do help these moments but generally the editing could of been a bit tighter the plot also sidetracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust which seemed out of place in this movie finally their are almost too many characters in the film and despite the running time the film never really spends enough time on them some of the characters are very slight which is a shame the conclusion while funny is also surprisingly weak and certainly not strong enough but despite these qualms the last days of disco is a funny warm movie which is certainly worth seeing and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80s worth a look overall rating review by david wilcock 1998 you know for kids norville barnes 
gordon fleming peter mullan is in a bind he has a new unexpected baby and his business hazardous material removal is in danger of going under when he and his crew get a job opportunity at the longabandoned danvers state hospital he underbids the competition to secure the contract and promises to get the threeweek job done in one it will prove to be a fateful week for them all in session 9 gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices there their guided tour of the facility by a local official bill giggs paul guilfoyle brings them through some of the creepier parts of the former asylum but a job is a job and if they finish in a week as promised there is a 10000 bonus in store as they get down to their work things normal and not so normal begin to happen gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him phil david caruso is conflicted working with a guy hank josh lucas who is seeing his old girlfriend mike coscreenwriter steven gevedon has discovered a cache of audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions hence the title with inmate mary hobbs a multipersonality patient with a dark secret gordos nephew jeff brendan sexton iii suffers from night phobia and is afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital as the agreed upon week draws to an end hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after a nocturnal confrontation with someone something in the hospital tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance for the bonus start to slip away but there is more much more at stake as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all i dont want to give away too much of the story of session 9 so ill stop there what we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of the jumpoutatyoufromthedark cheap shots that have become part and parcel with horror films since the advent of halloween and friday the thirteenth there is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror with the exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude in the film there is little that you can get your arms around as far as what specifically is frightening as i watched session 9 i became aware of the subtle things that built up during the story that make it a true horror movie the striking highdefinition video camera work by uta briesewitz who worked with the director brad anderson on his next stop wonderland helps to build up tension with closeups fluid camera movement and odd angles in a way that would make alfred hitchcock proud music too is used to intense effect joining with the camera to make simple scenes frightening even horrifying couple these tech feats with an intelligent story that uses elements of the shining the blair witch project and even the texas chainsaw massacre and you get a decent intriguing horror flick additionally the brilliant decision to shoot at danvers state hospital gives the film another starring character the institution itself which lends even more chills to the equation acting is another factor that raises session 9 above the usual dreck presented in recent horror hits like scream i know what you did last summer and their sequels those films took goodlooking though generic young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count substituting mayhem for real horror anderson opted instead to use mature experienced actors like peter mullan and david caruso to fill his characters shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable mullan in particular puts an arc on his character gordon as the troubled guy who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family job and finally danvers state hospital the rest of the small cast fit the bill as people not just fodder for the mayhem david caruso as gordos senior man and near equal in the business shows just how good an actor he is he made the jump from tvs nypd blue to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took ill never forget the horrendous jade were less than star making he rolls his sleeves up and does the job well here gevedon lucas and sexton are more than fodder too the only problem with session 9 lay in the uninspired ending it takes on a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a disappointment after the terrific and inspired build up the pleasure is getting there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so ably built during the bulk of the film session 9 is an unusual feat it is scary doesnt use cheap tricks and raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered subtle horror because of the local interest of danvers it should do well with the northeast crowd i hope it gets the national distribution it deserves i give it a b 
the latest epos from lars is a blast although a rather moody one this lovestory is situated in a small town in the rough dreary cliffs in the vestern part of scotland in the 1970 something the church calvinistic is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower they are considered being too unrestrained in these surroundings we find the tobeweds jan and bess played by stellan skarsgaard and the remarkable new movie actress emily watson jan is on leave from the oilrig and bess is just bess a bit naive and innocent in every aspect of the word at first at the wedding party we are told an anecdote illustrating her infinite kindness she once lend a bike to an stranger her best friends bike however but bess is suffering in this scary religious society we soon take part in a funeral where a man fallen off the orthodox path is laid to rest while doomed to hell women are not allowed to attend funerals or speak up in the church when the end of the honeymoon approaches we see bess idolizing jan in such an intend almost manic that her friends try to calm her down a bit the time has come when jan is to return to the rig bess is falling into the darkness of depression her yelling of grief and sorrow are heard above the breaking of the waves she cant stand the thought of life without her husband we witness her dialogues with god she speaks both parts paranoia convincing god to return jan from the oilrig and her prayers are heard an accident on the rig bring him back paralysed from the neck and down now he cant satisfy her need for physical love he try to persuade her into finding a lover with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail at first she resist but her love for jan and his assurance that this will make him recover more rapidly make her comply imagine what this is doing to the poor girl the story is cleverly divided into eight chapters parted by beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby accompanied by music from the era procol harum deep purple trex and others the use of handheld camera and lack of any makeup make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre the incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant though a bit too gloomy for my taste i would say that it is in the genre of betty blue 37 2 le matin and bitter moon lunes de fiel emily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances this must be the reason for giving it the grand prix du jury in cannes this year although we had hoped for the palme dor the screenplay is now available in print the transformation being made in the period from ultimo may to july just in time for the danish premiere 
anastasia contains something that has been lacking from all of the recent disney releases especially hercules emotion all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities and fantastically animated adventure sequences arent going to hold anyones interest unless there is an emotional core to hold it all together not since disneys beauty the beast has there been such a compelling animated film with interesting characters and drama that works the story of the romanov family the rulers of russia and their downfall begins the film anastasia one of the daughters narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin voiced by christopher lloyd with her grandmother voiced by angela landsbury but anastasia gets lost and grows up with no memory of her royal origins the grandmother lives in paris hoping to someday find her beloved anastasia the only member of the family to survive the russian revolution a young woman named anya voiced by meg ryan runs across dimitri john cusack and vlad kelsey grammar who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money they pick anya to pose as their princes and of course it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner and meanwhile rasputin is not dead and plots his revenge against the last romanov the plot is actually quite well structured there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later but it moves along fast enough that theyll never have time to be bored what this really means is that the adults wont be bored by it either there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses there is of course lots of comedy for the kids including rasputins pet bat bartok hank azaria who is easily the funniest thing in the film however the comical scenes never distract from the drama but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly the animation is gorgeous the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators not since beauty the beast have animated characters had so much life to them even without the voices they act the musical number in paris is a showstopper with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style as with all recent animated features there are songs however these songs do more than just provide fodder for top40 singers to get on the radio although there are three of them during the end credits the songs are all very catchy and advance the plot instead of just being showpieces except for the paris number but thats so much fun its okay i cant reccomend anastasia highly enough its a wonderful film that ranks right up there with other animated classics kids and adults alike will enjoy it and its also nice to have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney 
i can hear the question already what on earth do these two movies have in common to most people not a lot except that both are by renowned directors as i saw them however both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers but oh how differently the packages affect their films while everyones production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special jane campions imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones script is i left everyone says i love you not remembering a lot about who loved whom but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face i left the portrait of a lady not remembering a lot about who loved whom and i could have cared less everyone features nothing allen hasnt done before storywise woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman roberts and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrongagain similar situations happen to his family and friends some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his early funny films the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of take the money and run his directorial debut however nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this oneofakind display of sheer good spirits in fact in this movie the feeling itself is whats most important yes the movie would have been betteramong his very best i thinkif it had a meatier story but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling and what better way to express feeling than through music love is often best expressed in a song and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart some are a tad too goofy such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor but i admired allen for even putting them in there it also helps that as usual allen has a topflight cast working with him their singing voices range from quite good goldie hawn to not quite good allen to literally unlistenable barrymore whose real voice was dubbed by a professional but while their vocal abilities differ all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen and making it rub off on the audience granted some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies but for those attuned to it this film should work wonders jane campion too has a topflight cast working for her in portrait of a lady too but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted virtually lifeless mess albeit a visually interesting one campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eyefilling images that linger in the mind unfortunately what didnt linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people even worse i dont find myself feeling bad that ive forgotten the problem i think lies not with the cast which seemed to be trying very hard for the material it was the script that couldnt convince me to care about anyone the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion but i found no reason to connect with any of them i understood that the story was about cold emotionally vacant characters but for me to care about them i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives jones script never simply gave me that opportunity in the end it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes unfortunately as she kept painting these dazzling pictures they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film in the end the movies one strength ended up hurting it so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them why with both films my head cared about neither story but only everyone says i love you was able to make my heart sing 
youve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk the title is generic its meaningless and i cant believe its good business when you pick up the phone and dial 777film how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jeanclaude van damme movie the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot is called geez maximum risk yuck the movie itself deserves your attention for sweet bloody thrills this one beats the summer blockbuster competition handsdown only mission impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller and ill give maximum risk the edge simply because its not as slick as the tom cruise picture and therefore more gratifying in its execution much to my surprise van damme continues to develop as a pleasant unpretentious action hero his track record isnt as solid as schwarzeneggers but hes a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold in 1993 van damme worked with hong kongs premier hardcore action director john woo on a fairly lame movie called hard target if you can find a bootleg copy woos radically different directors cut is much better than what was eventually released this followup is directed by ringo lam city on fire full contact whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woos more operatic offerings the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woos subsequent broken arrow heres the rundown van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend jeanhugues anglade finds a corpse thats alains exact double turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother michael who has been killed by some russian heavies and some strangely american looking cops alain does some investigating he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia assuming michaels identity alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michaels girlfriend natasha henstridge the fbi and the russian mob in little odessa thats as much as you need to know the story is adequate but not overly involving and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment theres a love story too but i didnt find it terribly convincing partly because exmodel henstridge is too highstrung in her highprofile debut she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species shes great to look at and she can certainly read a line but what she does here cant really be described as acting of course acting isnt really what she was hired for i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van dammes the movie is exceptionally violent bordering on gratuity keep that in mind when planning your date the stunts are spectacular and the fact that you can spot van dammes standin makes his work no less impressive theres only so much you can do with a car wreck but this movie makes crisp effective use of pileups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies and lam has a surprising innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action the main difference between lam and woo i believe is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and doublebarreled points of view to make things run dont get me wrong when chow yunfat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woos hardboiled its an amazing moment but its a moment thats hard to reproduce in hollywood for one thing hollywood doesnt yet have chow yunfat while woos hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city but lams use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lams shooting style accentuating rather than amplifying the action the performances could have used some fine tuning in particular theres an annoying overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely and the movie doesnt always overcome the limitations of its genre the story is a little mundane although there are some effective moments involving van dammes unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had but its not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture and its doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the mans best movie and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong konghollywood hybrid 
in many ways twotg does for toughguy movies what la confidential did for police stories theres savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold but i suppose we wouldnt expect less from christopher mcquarrie who was responsible for giving us the usual suspects his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry the two goons are parker and longbaugh ryan phillipe and benicio del toro these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime theyll always choose the latter yet they are incredibly foolish planners actually these two never really have a plan they just improvise along the way hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked their next scheme which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonalds burger is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin juliette lewis that was hired by some welltodo family if all goes well theyll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family whose patriarch is a feared crime boss moreover two bodyguards nicky katt and taye diggs constantly escort her these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations they would rather die than fail thus their bravado level is equally high but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher and they employ some unusual but funtowatch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slowmotion car chase down a series of alleyways the next hour or so we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation during this time additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed because the chidducks can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause as a result there are undercurrents of a conspiracy and elements of betrayal and subterfuge the sepiatoned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur the momentum and the coolness of the film however begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement in fact you may admire this film more than you like it yet for the most part the way of the gun stays on target it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry

is it just me or have disney films gradually lost their appeal i was almost stunned by the quality of who framed roger rabbit a fun unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animations from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wannabes is getting to me you know the spiel a lame plot recycled from some wellknown story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekicksidekicks the seemingly unattainable love interest a few catchy songs a few injokes for adults and the occasional out of place warnerbrotherscoyotefalloffthecliff type joke its a formula and like any formula it gets tiresome thats why im delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli a japanese cartoon studio from what ive seen of their movies kikis delivery service and the already englishdubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audiences are in for a treat these movies particularly kikis delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kikis delivery service starts with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecasts of clear skies decides it is time for her to leave home this is unusual because kiki isnt a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch her mother is also a witch and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kikis mother acts as a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the costar of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she has been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding shes discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch on the verge of leaving for a new town she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier a onepersons delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kikis job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesnt seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light theyre three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of faults and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl however each one has something about them some interest or trait that makes them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely looks impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950s this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozens are only hinted at i could probably go on all day but i wont suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorites are kikis relationship with the bakers husband although hes quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scares her his kindness wins her friendship in the garage of a deliverees house can be found a vintage model t two old ladies have a relationship evolving from masterservant to friendfriend such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of selfworth kiki initially seems to derive much of her selfworth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this causes kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i dont even want to hint at it the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disneyesque moment ive ever seen if you dont hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions there is no violence however cartoonish no songanddance number and kikis pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes however i would be surprised if disney doesnt give jiji more jokes or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not selfcontradicted a habit disney movies have gotten into beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty was derived from a persons inside and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her selfimage and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for kikis delivery service not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fits the movie to a t this is particularly true with scenes of kikis flights the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film ive ever seen im not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states disney tentatively plans a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer 97 japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that id guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate its good to know that its being released at all for kikis delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bites dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie ive ever seen 
insane but inspired musical about alferd packer the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america as the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer trey parker supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold throughout packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse a tribe of ute indians that doesnt seem quite on the mark and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism parker obviously knows his musicals very well because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film he would accomplish this again in his postcannibal musical motion picture south park bigger longer and uncut apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre south park parker and stone in their first effort cannibal also offers up some pretty decent laughs the aforementioned ute indian tribe that packers group encounters is a definite highlight as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen one of which ends on a comedically deadly note stones humphrey character steals the show especially when complaining about the prospect of having to eat butt or revealing whats underneath his muff cap jason mchughs character of mr miller is the stand out performance though as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings as i mentioned before parkers songs are very catchy youll be hard pressed to get its a shpadoinkle day out of your head once youve heard it incidentally the braniff logo that appears at the end of every south park episode is scored with a few notes from this song other songs youll find yourself humming include when i was on top of you a love ballad the trappers song the villains leit motif and hang the bastard the rousing finale thankfully none of these songs are quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park bigger longer uncuts songs are released as a pickup through troma studios the film is available on videocassette and dvd the videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball there are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films as for the dvd well thats a different story probably one of the best dvd packages of the year and potentially of all time cannibal the musical the dvd is a massive achievement presented in 1 33 1 full frame only the disc has the usual troma inclusions the tour of troma the troma intelligence test 2 trailers for upcoming releases but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal specific extras the first thing i must note is the transfer is about as beautiful as any ive ever seen on any disc the picture is crisp clear and free from any noticeable artifacts add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard featuring trey parker matt stone jason mchugh dian bachar and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still havent scratched the surface of the extras theres also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film a clip with trey matt and lemmy of the band motorhead from the film terror firmer an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film and finally an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal its good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time

at one point during brian de palmas crime epic scarface the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves cant you stop saying fuck all the time fucking good question that it may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride but as far as i can tell oliver stones script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palmas scarface is remembered for because this is a damn fine gangstar flick the overall structure is similar to howard hawks 1932 original but this time the scene has switched to miami florida and our antiheros chosen vice is cocaine traffiking pacino sporting a thick cuban accent gives one the best performances of his career golden globe nominated as tony montana a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream and live it out he does with lashings of violence abuse murder and the funny white powder from his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that hes not a man to be fucked sorry soon hes the king of the cocaine heap but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing never do your own stash warns one character early in the film as sure as night follows day the emperor of miami eventually falls writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here stones script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development montana is fascinating uneducated but calculating a straight shooter who speaks from the heart an ambitious violent man yet one with a conscience a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy dangerous world which he inhabits pacino is dynamite taking to the role with a brooding bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends and shes happy to oblige this isnt as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stones was in casino but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well as director de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva the escalating tension he creates in various mob situations a drug deal gone wrong an assination attempt is often thrilling and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola where he differs from say coppolas godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel and it perfectly suits the material the only major botch is giorgio moroders mostly crap synthesier score its just not right and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes as expected scarface is very violent at times but you shouldnt be watching gangster movies if that upsets you at over two and a half hours in length its a true epic and if youre a fan of the genre youll love f kfilled minute of it 
for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend there are certain rules that he needs to follow firstly fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship secondly buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes thirdly find the perfect moment and location to propose finally the groomwannabe should probably get her parents blessing of these four the last one can be a nightmare meeting parents is a rite of passage fraught with unexpected questions bouts of nervousness the reality of being disliked and the inability to make a positive impression if youre lucky things will go smoothly but if youre greg focker ben stiller everything will go wrong and with a name like that how could it not when greg first meets his fianc es father jack byrnes the grimacing robert deniro greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive when he tells jack that hes a male nurse the incorrigible dad shoots back not many men in your profession huh greg its definitely not a good start but greg is determined to win him over and its this desire that fuels the movie he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner it doesnt matter that hes jewish if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace then thats what hes going to gamely do oh god youre such a good god he moons his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle but when jack gives him the deniro squint that familiar unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility its pretty hard not to grin things get progressively worse for greg and thats too bad because hes a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart eventually he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up committing a host of gaffes that embarrass humiliate or injure other people its a neverending ordeal of missteps miscues and mistakes he buys some champagne but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances he tries to find jacks missing cat but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble and there are several other episodes each one trumping the next in outrageousness the more our wellmeaning beau screwed up the more the audience groaned in sympathy we liked greg and we liked this movie meet the parents is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments just sit back and watch greg get into trouble no matter what the situation whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house things will horribly go wrong we laugh at gregs expense but love often makes a person do dumb things and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool deniro is also affable tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside their tugofwar is often funny the slapstick is elaborate and there are several topical throwaway gags mostly targeted at the airline industry to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future inlaws from hell 
i like movies with albert brooks and i really like movies directed and written by albert brooks lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we cant brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenagers and jim carrey fans probably wont find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brooks comedy is intelligent mother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint brooks plays john henderson a middleaged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff has a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunkydory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart johns life she says i love you and john replies with i know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nitpicking and guilt loading its the kind that goes something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy theres always the big but john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed selfesteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he calls it brooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother theres a scene where john has just arrived at his mothers house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you dont want to stay at a hotel she still doesnt get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze youve named the ice asks john hes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as a twentypound block of cheese the freezer was a good invention says john but its not supposed to be used for everything thats why its smaller than the refrigerator its something most of us find strangely familiar brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streeps characters are in a comedy club having a discussion when theyre finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you dont know what the joke was because you couldnt hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context in this film brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene i dont want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past johns purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world in a way hes very much like yosarian of catch22 expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable its hard to get mad at her character this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her as his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimers disease that may be just as well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mothers favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as a mamas boy the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes a solid connection is not really made between johns troubles and his reasons for living with his mother additionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think im some kind of moron john no i think your someone who thinks im a moron beatrice well it takes one to know one 
 note there are spoilers regarding the films climax the election of course we see matthew broderick a man torn to a primal state hes been unfaithful to his wife lied to and manipulated his students and by the same token theyve demeaned his masculinity his selfrespect his desperate attempt at changing the world and yet he equates the cause of his pain his torment with tracy flick reese witherspoon no matter how many students have come and gone and disappointed him as an educator shes the real threat about to give in and divulge that shes won by only a lone vote brodericks mccalister turns in defeat sees tracys euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says no the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men no matter how obscure have in their relationships a traditional expectation of success to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry she cant go higher than him he wont allow it and whats amazing about election is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically and then sexually involved with a now departed teacher its like payne and taylor his coscreenwriter have taken tracy a girl desperate for friendship loyalty and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers that they found sitting at the teachers lunch table more fitting to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist and its amazing the compassion that we have it seems so real to us and not merely because its happened before splashed all over the front pages but because of the all around nice persona of these people we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters its with mandy barnetts if youll be the teacher playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most a final viscous injection of bittersweet irony sexuality though is not the only basis for paynes satire or its success it also makes a telling point about politics friendship and class boundaries satire is required or ought to be anyway to take itself seriously or act so while the audience does not its a fine line to straddle but some films ignore it altogether drop dead gorgeous leaps infuriatingly to mind payne and taylor hit the right chord their characters are real people neither is perfect but rather both of the leads are flawed misguided individuals who retain somewhat noble intentions at heart we sympathize with them but still as a satire their idiosyncratic behavior and their wrongdoing is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle but also reflect and meditate about minus half a point though for payne admitting not to having seen ferris buellers day off whatever 
martin scorseses films used to intimidate me because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks as much as i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something i learned from scorseses casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies for example in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on or toward the end when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing i dont mean to say that his techniques are not creative or goodlooking but he simply uses the best tool for the job it shouldnt have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movies title is another name for the dalai lama which means ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story one of which makes an interesting statement pay attention to the films opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old his curiosity and selfassuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own the boy picks correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and longtime editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lamas spirit and the future leader of a nation it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child in the u s it might be grounds for a call to social services but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable wellrounded person certain patterns take shape over the years for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radios clocks and telescopes are some of his favorite toys when he is old enough to accept his leadership he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain including herd animals its nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibets gigantic neighbor china tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china as first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the armies come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lamas life is in danger if he stays the movie ends when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaves tibet for india the story doesnt lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do it just doesnt fit that mold if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven years in tibet which is good in its own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events not viceversa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestments and architecture of tibet a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold the bricks are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he was the perfect choice for those who dont know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala his building blocks are lots of small notes tiny grains of music which are first grouped then repeated in patterns these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition people wont be flocking to kundun for its great ending or talking about its outstanding plot but it does have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sights rich cinematography and innovative music it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who gives the film a strong beautiful consistent look 
robert redfords a river runs through it is not a film i watch often it is a masterpiece one of the better films of recent years until 1994 it was my second favorite film of all time the acting and direction is topnotch never sappy always touching a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because i was afraid it would just be really politically correct and tick me off all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased and enjoy it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears but certain memories should not often be rereleased in the last few shots you have to cry upon my first viewing i left bawling it is not flawless but it is so very good that you cant help but be effected the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental watching these shots of people who have been dead so long gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state like taking dope and immersing yourself in an alternative world that is what a river runs through it does it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self both times ive seen it its been hard again to quote scorsese waking up but the dream is lovely 
richard gere is not one of my favorite actors however i like courtroom dramas and this film looked good enough to take a chance on i wasnt disappointed it wasnt a great film but it was interesting and took several unexpected turns one thing whats with the title not only is it extremely forgettable it doesnt really have much to do with the film as far as i could determine in the long run it will probably hurt the film as people wont be able to think of or remember it martin vail richard gere is a grandiose defense attorney he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending successfully rich scum such as mafia men and drugdealers once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a babyfaced alter boy he wants in on the case presumably for the press hell get we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover janet venable laura linney vail himself is a former prosecutor and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney played very well by john mahoney frasiers father on the tv series there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie people have public faces and private faces we see this in the murdered archbishop in the accused and most strongly defense attorney martin vail richard gere does a fairly good job at first he appears to be a money and attentiongrabbing lawyer with no consideration of the truth but we see another side as he becomes a seeker of justice and comes to believe in his client alfre woodard as the judge is capable though somewhat wasted in a standard role laura linney also does journeyman work nothing spectacular but acceptable her relationship with vail is believable their verbal fencing adds to the film the actor who playes vails investigator unfortunately i dont remember his name is quite good his female assistant she looked very familiar but i cant remember where ive seen her was also capable but unspectacular the best performance in the film was by edward norton he was excellent as the timid altarboy turned alleged butcher boy of st mikes i was impressed by the depth of the plot there are redherrings and deadends that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending i liked the plot twists the film took and most of the supporting characters thus i give primal fear a respectable b rating 
 when you get out of jail you can kill him starring ashley judd tommy lee jones bruce greenwood rated r double jeopardy is a lurid prepostrous thriller thats also one of the years most enjoyable its an uncompromisingly brutal cheerfully anarchic hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it there is not a moment here when the events on screen dont have a direct bearing on the plot once the film gets going it never stops it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and thats probably a correct assessment of the plot but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davisharrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones not even bothering with character introduction director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the getgo and never finds the brake we meet rather hastily libby and nick parsons ashley judd and bruce greenwood respectively a seemingly happy married couple with a son matty age 4 they go out on a sailboat one night and after a period of some rockin sex they go to sleep libby hears a strange noise wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood she follows a red trail to the upper deck where she finds a knife and out of astonishment picks it up at that convenient moment the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested her lawyer a friend puts up a defense in court but though we know she is innocent the evidence against her is too compelling her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison once in prison she makes a phone call to her friend her friend gives her son the phone nick walks in the room little matty screams daddy the phone goes dead libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isnt even dead she gets some advice from a prisonerformer lawyer who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband they cant convict her of the same crime again meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they cant touch her after a weirdly short amount of time she gets out of parole she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees under the command of parole officer travis lehman tommy lee jones she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her sons adopter double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime same time same place same circumstances its not like it matters this is a rollickingly good thriller intense exciting fast and furious its silly alright but this is the kind of film you just dont question in some films plausibility is everything double jeopardy however is not concerned with making sense its sole purpose is to entertain and it does judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role this is her breakout boxoffice performance and she is terrific she brings some emotion to what could have been a onedimensional role giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive but the movie makes good use of his stonefaced wit thankfully too double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the films story this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system its great to see a movie that doesnt so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure double jeopardy is really good but it isnt the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards its one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off otherwise your brain will be busy ruining your experience this is a thriller that isnt concerned with being smart or plausible instead it diverts all attention to the action which this year is second to none 
lets say you live at the end of an airport runway large jetliners continuously pass over your house rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace lets say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home now lets say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway and offers you more than its worth wouldnt you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed of course you would but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise and the house your castle thats what they are to darryl kerrigan michael caton and although hes happy that a multinational corporation would like to buy his home sorry its not for sale unfortunately the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice not about to take this lying down darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto tiriel mora and makes a determined albeit pathetic attempt to fight back the castle an australian comedy by rob sitch is perhaps one of the simplest movies ive seen in recent memory yet also one of the funniest in fact it is this films reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful the good guys and the bad guys are clear the humor is straightforward and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets its the perfect setup for a relaxing hilarious good time and as much as i hate to admit it i liked the fact that i didnt have to think all that much while watching this film i just sat back and enjoyed myself the situation is one weve seen before regular joe fights back against the government or big business or whatever what makes this film different is its characters darryl thinks hes got the best life in the world he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when hes got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal anne tenny and he swells with pride when his son dale stephen curry digs a hole in the yard steve kerrigan anthony simcoe constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for investments like jousting sticks and overhead projectors while wayne kerrigan is in jail as a result of dennis denutos incompetent courtroom maneuvers the great thing about the kerrigans is that they arent so stupid that they get annoying theyre just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing we look upon them with a little bit of pity but a whole lot of affection screenwriters sitch santo cilauro tom gleisner and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans sympathy for their situation the laughter they bring us and the familys wonderful characterization simple as it may be leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans but trust me it works i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs dont get me wrong slapstick when executed well can be genius its just that too often a film will resort to its use as a shortcut to amusing the audience not always successfully instead the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world when they are by themselves the are funny and when they are with normal people they are hilarious one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the films running time luckily its a funny little detour that while slightly distracting from the films main drive is still quite enjoyable with all the levity abound in the castle the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes im not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution of australia and certainly sounds impressive at any rate and for that matter its more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this 
in this good natured pleasent and easy going comedy bill murray ghostbusters 1984 plays grumpy weatherman phil conners who every year is sent to punxsutawney p a to report on groundhog day the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog being lifted out of a box and if he dosent see a shadow it will be an early spring phil really hates the ceremony and not even his producer rita macdowell can change his mind however fate has a cruel trick for phil and he starts reliving groundhog day over and over and over until he gradually likes it and rita falls in love with him groundhog day is a well written totatly unoffensive and funny comedy the screenwriters director ramis and danny rubin have written a funny warm but never overly senitmental comedy although the idea of a day repeating over and over may sound tedious there are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the whole film ramiss direction also helps and although he dosent try any flash director tricks the film is directed well enough and the jokes are set up well and the editing is also good especially when it shows one part of the day over and over again such as when phil tries to have the perfect night with rita the performances are also excellent bill murray is great fun and his transistion from cynical to happy is smooth and delivers his lines in his usual smary style andie macdowell is good as rita although sometimes she is just a little bit too sweet in some parts of the film there is chemistry between the two leads thankfully otherwise the whole film would probably fall part chris elliot as the cameraman larry is also funny although you have to like his goofy style otherwise you are really going to hate him throughout this film and it will lower your enjoyment of the film overall the supporting cast arent bad either with stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils old school mate ned ryanson and even director ramis popping up as a neurologist in fact there is not one dud performance in this film and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase overall there is really nothing wrong with groundhog day at all it almost seems perfect however the film can get a bit soppy sometimes and some people may get irritated by the day repeating over and over and over and over also theres not much of an music score and the music there is is pretty bad but these criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all overall then groundhog day is a funny smart and also has some room in there for some heart an excellent comedy overall rating 
 no man is an island one character quotes john donne in apt pupil effectively summarizing the movies themes while hardly a great film singers ambitious adaptation of kings short story is challenging nonetheless perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses 1984 wonderbred high school honours student todd bowden renfro conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again bowden suspects arthur denker mckellan the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby is actually a pseudonymous dussandermuch research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todds theory bowden strikes a deal with dussander in exchange for not revealing his identity dussander must satisfy bowdens intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams but like a bystander at a traffic accident todds desire for gory details overrides his repulsion bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his student among other things bowden who has taken on very hateful qualities he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook engages the veteran in an endless game of oneupmanship dussander stands to lose his freedom and bowden his credibilityin effect his postsecondary school future all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable and unsettling conclusion one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source materials excessive climax singer has yet to get keyser s ze out of his system his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence verbals tics and todds goldenboy reputation are plausible ruses they showcase morally bankrupt antiheroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcomethere was no way you could see the ending coming as it was all a hoodwink anyway thankfully singer has gotten most of the usual suspects filmschoolish geek theatrics out of his system some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected andor obvious the dream sequences were extraneous but the majority of the film is subduedand singers handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murdererintraining mckellans and renfros performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellans finelytuned realization id like to single out renfros daring work he isnt afraid to play someone largely unappealing and coldhearted he strips his character of vanity something many of his peers wouldnt do can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylorthomas in the same role renfro was recently charged with possession of cocainei hope he doesnt continue down that path because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him as guidance counsellor edward french friend schwimmer also deserves mention he wants to be the parent to todd that todds own welltodo folks are not todd like most modern kidsand onlychildrenhas mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger and his sincerity makes the apt pupils blackeningheart even more apparent but one of the films ultimate questions are we born evil or do we learn evil might be answered in french whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous no man is an island indeedwe all have the capacity to make the right or the wrong choices schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible october 1998 the excellent collection kings stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil but the shawshank redemption originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption and stand by me originally titled the body 
i rented this movie with very high hopes this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 and unfortunately was not as good as i hoped but was still very intriguing and thought provoking first of all the casting for this film is great tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly with a plot as unbelievable as this film you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast tobey and reese bud and mary sue parker play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability william h macy an actor i have grown to love over the past year turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife a colored person and his friends the noncolored ones he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood joan allen is equally great as betty parker the ideal tv mom her character is the most ambitious she is very na ve and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that her lack of chemistry with macy which the role calls for and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast then this film would even been even better as said before jeff daniels gives a bad performance his character displays the change going on throughout the town yet he does not display it with enough conviction his character is very confusing and he is not very believable this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance the movie is very provocative it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch but do it in a slow pace the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length some films are not meant to be that long pleasantville is one of those films this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it first they are amazed by the implementation of color then they want to have it then they do not want to then the war ensues between the colored and noncolored this is all strung out over two hours which was way too long some movies need a lot of time saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time this film is only two hours long and seems much longer length is everything in films if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace you can win half the battle pleasantville can move at a good pace at times but it is not consistent enough overall pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days i went in expecting a lighthearted film about change i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change luckily pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time 
few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parkers adaptation of frank mccourts memoir angelas ashes many dismissed it as an humorless sentimentalized uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel others hailed it as a heartfelt sincere portrait of the human spirit im somewhere in between leaning strongly towards the latter its certainly wellmade and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudolyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the twoandahalf hour running time that screams im important mccourts book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900s a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us as he comments we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty in ireland frank played by joe breen as a small child his 3 brothers his mother angela emily watson and his father malachy robert carlyle get financial help from angelas mother a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman she helps them get a ratinfested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job positions are scarce and when he does finally find one he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking meanwhile frank goes to an uptight catholic school where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires two of franks brothers soon die crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition as if the poverty and the suffering werent intense enough as it stood malachy and angela have another baby worsening the situation further i imagine this doesnt sound like much of a plot thats probably because it isnt one these are people this is their story director alan parker the commitments knows how to tell a good story and angelas ashes despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue supplementing parkers able direction are the engaging often poignant performances of the leads some of them seasoned thespians others relative beginners carlyle the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character we empathize with the guy but we dont like or admire him emily watson turns in a heartfelt sincere supporting performance it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats also worthy of mention is little joe breen whose face graces the films superb poster it is breens first feature film and hes extraordinary as young frank not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense you can peer into the characters soul through breens sad eyes on the flip side one thing that could have vastly improved angelas ashes is a more decisive editor while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage the first half especially could have been trimmed down bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process things pick up at about the halfway point sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary spoiler warning skip next paragraph if in suspense the films final message is somewhat conflicted as frankie in effect leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america what exactly are we supposed to make of that his mother doesnt seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son as any mother would but it still seems inconsiderate of him i havent read the book but im sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein therefore im suspicious another thing thats never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title which im sure is also explained in the memoir if seen as a film onto itself rather than an adaptation angelas ashes stands tall despite a few minor setbacks it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder 
now that boogie nights has made disco respectable again well fashionable at least we shouldnt be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era the latest art house interpretation is whit stillmans the last days of disco stillman who made metropolitan and barcelona using some of the same actors uses discos final hours to highlight what is another conversationheavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director the young upwardlymobile professional dont call them yuppies men and women of the last days of disco frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the basspounding rhythms of earth wind and fire amy grant and andrea true connection here they talk and talk and talk intellectualizing about such things as dating success and being liked accepted and admired if talk is cheap the last days of disco must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie harvardeducated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit perception and style including at one point a riotously inventive deconstruction of the lady and the tramp na ve alice chlo sevigny and sophisticated charlotte kate beckinsale are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house charlotte is confident and outspokenperhaps a little too outspoken alice is shy and introverted like a kindergarten teacher the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot looking good and looking for excitement and that ms beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor here they meet or remeet a variety of eligible men many of whom they knew in college des played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman is one of the clubs managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back des has reached a crisis point in his life he just found outlast wednesday in factthat hes gay whether its true or not it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend jennifer beals in a small but soulbaring turn charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth jimmy mackenzie astin is the advertising exec who by the end of the picture winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain visions of barcelona josh matt keeslar is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say just once book this clown and robert sean leonard plays another one of alices revolving suitors the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book in fact the entire ensemble is appealing in that wellspoken stillman way while the eschewing of ferocious pairing is a favored topic of conversation in the film the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love lust and trouble with each other in an emotional merrygoround that cleverly develops its characters through the preferred dynamics of social group interaction more mature than stillmans previous two films the last days of disco is as consistently droll as it is stimulating its a movie you should definitely get on down to 
this has been an extraordinary year for australian films shine has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards picking up best film best actor best director etc to that we can add the gritty life the anguish courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hivpositive section of a jail and love and other catastrophes a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus i cant recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia shine was one bookend stand by for the other one dead heart from the opening credits the theme of division is established the cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names bryan brown in a desert settlement hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby the local police officer has the task of enforcing white mans justice to the aboriginals these are people with a proud 40 000 year heritage behind them naturally this includes their own system of justice key to which is payback an eye for an eye revenge usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipients thigh brown as the officer manages quite well to keep the balance he admits that he has to bend the rules a bit including actively encouraging at least one brutal payback be warned that this scene near the start is not for the squeamish the local priest an aboriginal but in the white fellas church has a foot on either side of the line he is figuratively and literally in both camps ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle he is part churchman and part politician however the tension like the heat flies and dust is always there whilst her husband the local teacher is in church white lady kate milliken and her aborginal friend tony pedersen have gone off into the hills he takes her to a sacred site even today strictly menonly she appears to not know this tony tells her that this is a special place an initiation place he then makes love to her surrounded by ancient rock art the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and its payback time the fuse is lit and the brittle interracial peace is shattered everyone is affected in the fall out to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film suffice to say its a rewarding experience bryan brown acting and coproducing is the pivotal character his officer is real human and therefore flawed brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man then suddenly feel angry about him it wasnt long ago that i visited central australia ayers rock uluru and alice springs for the first time the widescreen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures its vicious beauty but never deteriorates into a moving slide show in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film from the western to the birdcage at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglosaxon invaders jedda the chant of jimmie blacksmith and the last wave in a year when the race debate has reared up in australia it is nourishing to see such an intelligent nonjudgemental film as dead heart the aboriginal priest best sums this up he is asked to say if he is a black fella or white fella 
i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the xfiles first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producers are not stupid making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite userfriendly altough nonfans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the xfiles i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movies opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoilers follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the xfiles is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effects unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performances this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie does not let go of you when i compare it with last summers movies the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from faceoff and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes in fact the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the xfiles is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the xfiles is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minutes total no the xfiles is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much no this is mulders time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder showers independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you lets just say that due to recent events mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who cares if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i cannot stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movies the dialogue is twice as important as the effects miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movies you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies dont the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scenes because again unlike most summer movies godzilla anybody the xfiles does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serves a purpose who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attacks so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies id recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the xfiles is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effects its got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while nonfans will have a good time it does not provide answers to the shows many questions the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrills many whoah i never saw that one coming moments four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop its pretty obvious the films makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving 
trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors steve buscemi he gave memorable performences in in the soup fargo and reservoir dogs now he tries his hand at writing directing and acting all in the same flick the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy buscemi hanging around a local bar the trees lounge and him pestering his brother its obvious he a loser but as he says its better im a loser and know i am then being a loser and not thinking i am well put the story starts to take off when his uncle dies and tommy not having a job decides to drive an ice cream truck well the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie chloe sevigny and i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation after youve seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs you know he is capable of a better performence i think his brother michael did an excellent job for his debut performence mr buscemi is off to a good career as a director 
i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials but there isnt george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effectsbound flicks and he has done it again this is the first star wars film ive seen on the big screen so of course the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story but its amazing visuals basically the films plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets quigon liam neeson and his young apprentice obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jarjar binks to fix the mess that may result in war when their ship breaks down and they are stranded they find a young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother quigon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing anakin participates in a heartpounding podrace one of the highlights of the film to get the equipment needed to fix quigons ship however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wits end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made in all the star wars films human emotions that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the films are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purposes despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaws for starters we have the illconceived moronic character jarjar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience what a klutz george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as say yoda r2d2 or c3po but alas his efforts were in vain secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movies atmosphere is so different from the familiar comicbook feel of the previous three star wars installments this is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movies plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions i cant say much about the acting though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway however there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances they are straightforward and at times stale natalie portman has a great presence but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic unfeeling enigma there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk despite the inevitable faults there is so much to enjoy about the movie the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesnt quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes but they are amazing and edgeofyourseat fun in their own rite the film is a treasure to look at the visual effects are astonishing 99 8 of the time the aweinspiring mouthopening eyepopping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius not since 1997s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star wars movies kubricks 2001 maybe even of fritz langs classic silent metropolis however all the sets are so original the original star wars movies cant even match the grandeur of this films visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode the costumes are remarkable and have jeanpaul gaultier written all over them whether its queen amadalas gigantic wardrobe complete with goldembroidery and feathers or the jedis simple brown uniforms the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie as for john williams score i dont think hes done one as complex or powerful since i cant even remember it is as epic as his schindlers list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films but williams has added on made the music much more intense and moving what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed there is very little to hate in the film its a very accomplished and skillfully made flick it is the best fun film and the best bigbudget film out today most definitely 
lisa cholodenkos high art is an intelligent quiet drama its strongest quality aside from the topnotch central performances is the perceptive way in which the film also written by cholodenko observes its characters they are all flawed people some more troubled than others but they are not judged judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers parts because no one no matter how bad off they are deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of syd radha mitchell a 24yearold woman living with her longtime boyfriend james gabriel mann has recently been awarded an ideal job at the highprofile photography magazine frame she very much enjoys where her career is headed but is often not taken very seriously by her managers who are always giving her petty jobs to do when she knows she could be doing more important things one night while taking a bath syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers so when she goes up there to inform them of it she meets lucy beliner ally sheedy a thin wornout and unhappy woman who lives with her drugaddicted german girlfriend greta patricia clarkson a pathetic former actress who is usually so outofit that she often is in and out of conciousness syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before lucy claims she doesnt want to get back into the profession but syd manages to convince the frame editors to do a piece on her work all the while syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons high art is such an effective motion picture because it is never sugercoated or idealized but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere while syds luck begins to rise the film in no way is about lesbianism but about love which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other even if the relationship might be doomed with this picture ally sheedys star has risen once again thanks to her touching nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy a woman who in the course of a decade has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs which has taken away her onceblossoming career her characted really is tragic and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem and her mother matteroffactly responds by saying she cant help her is heartbreaking although not autobiographical sheedy has had drug problems in her past and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucys footsteps to her role also very good is radha mitchell as syd who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy love and other catastrophes wh caught me by surprise with her performance easily being able to pass as christina riccis older sister mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently as accurate as almost every detail is in high art i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james who played by gabriel mann is left with a throwaway role by the time he finds out about syd and lucy he disappears from the film and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other this is a very minor fault however in a film that is full of riches although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems the character of dominique anh duong the frame editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas was also written to be far more mature than expected and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done for once it did not invlove steaminess or violent sexual activity or gratuitous nudity but focused on the actual characters who love each other and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex high art which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko as well as sheedys strongest and best role to date 
the relaxed dude rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider when those observers are joel and ethan coen the surreal becomes bizarre when the life is that of jeff the dude leboswki the bizarre falls over the edge into the world of whatsgoingonaroundhere the marvelous sound of the stranger sam elliot s voiceover introduces the film at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up the dude jeff bridges is described as the laziest man in los angeles possibly the world although hes not so much slothful as he is relaxed spending the last 30 years with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other he doesnt have much of a life but hes having a good time when asked what he does for fun he responds bowl drive around and the occasional acid flashback lebowskis passion is bowling when hes not rolling the ball down an alley towards a strike things just happen to him arriving home one night hes beaten by thugs attempting to collect money that his wife owes them even worse they urinate on his rug the problem is that the dude doesnt have a wife his assailants realize that their target is a different lebowski when they glance around at his apartment the big lebowski david huddleston is a multimillionaire and his dudeness lives in tworoom squalor the next day our ragtag hero visits his namesakes mansion attempting compensation for his soaked rug the carpet is important to him because it pulls the room together not surprisingly since its virtually the only object there when hes denied any money he picks up a replacement rug off the floor on his way out he runs into lebowskis trophy babe wife bunny tara reid who offers to perform a sexual act that according to rumor is one of bill clintons favorites for a thousand bucks the penniless dude wisecracks that hes heading for the cash machine later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being the bag man to deliver a ransom to bunnys kidnappers this begins the trademarked coen brothers crimesgonewrong sequences the kidnappers are impossibly inept the dude and his cronies are even worse every plan goes awry you can almost see lebowskis brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues thats the story but to tell the truth it doesnt much matter there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into the dudes bowling buddies walter john goodman and donny steve buscemi look like people youd see on the street but like everything else in this film theyre not quite what they seem walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but wont admit it walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet donny gets precious few words in between walters screaming and the dudes rambling when he does walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns donny is out of his league and doesnt have a frame of reference the film is peppered with people for whom the term character would be an understatement the big lebowskis daughter maude an avantgarde vaginal artist paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an sm mary martin the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler as the flamenco music swells we see him putting on his lavender hose the camera pans up to an allpurple skintight bowling outfit with jesus pronounced with a j not an h embroidered on the pocket he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has i cant think of anyone else who could have done a better job buscemi has a limited role but he plays it perfectly the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that hes one of the treasures of our time its odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barrs television husband more like the coens raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demands an open mind and even more open eyes a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss theres so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater i felt that the film had something important to say on further examination i wasnt sure exactly what it was if you meet jesus at the bowling alley its not going to be what you expect when the going gets weird the weird go bowling maybe theres no real message perhaps its just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world maybe thats enough michael redman has written this column for 23 years and just realized that he was so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about the man in the iron mask starring that favorite of 14yearold girls of all ages redmanbvoice com is the eaddress for estuff 
i dont box with kid gloves i dont play nice im not a nice guy and i never ever go easy on a film i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic however i do some favors and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery rigormortis the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking gets several of these points each time i still however will not go easy on them they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy which begins quite wittily with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it in the famous lines of many martyrs i have no regrets well i do have some regrets but that is not the point in the previous sentence the point of it was that down with america was a film that from a critical standpoint did not entirely disappoint me sure the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable down with america concerns a government agent needless murder and a book containing everything from the unabombers manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed it displays an offkilter humor and intelligence it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s a dying movement from the day they started these paranoid thrillers had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word roswell in down with america the line roswell is highly absent with an about ten minute running time down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich that the conspiracy films fell into makes jokes at them at the same time and provides us with funny and memorable characters again i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldnt care less about the film as previously stated concerns a federal agent peter roach an obsessed librarian meri stevens a mystery man joe kaczkowski and two people obsessed with silence in the library robb sherman kevin flowers the plot a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in a public library where it can be viewed by all from there we go into a delightful parody the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to noname it ends up being the noname people who do a good job delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out for once i dont have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of lauto and les xfiles and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself its almost as much fun as the film 
here is a film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop okay it isnt quite original considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy bhorror films from the 50s and 60s and some even become them however as we learned with the 1995 smallbudget horrorscifi film sometimes expectations can be shattered a lot of criticism has gone against this film from what i have read so far anywayyep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash but the thing is it isnt its well made well acted and quite intelligent i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film but the species series isnt about the lack of these elements its about how much it can get into one film and yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so species ii begins in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe many films especially scifi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it to fit the films needs species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars aboard is patrick ross justin lazard a very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick to succeed well it would seem that he has succeeded landing on the surface of mars he is the first human being to ever do so of course he isnt the first ever about a billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life now of course the red planet is cold and rocky no life lives on it that is no visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collects samples from the ground he takes them aboard and puts them in storage unfortunately one of the samples contains a form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship just prior to heading back to earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings they pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they cant even remember they blame it on a technical malfunction back on earth patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible as we know from the original this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet however the children that are bred are halfhuman as their father is patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge eve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable since she was involved with the original alien attack she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again and it has storywise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey i love the film but you cant tell me it was strong on story what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it the script uses this effectively but also manages to provide a wellbalanced plot beginning with the first man on mars something i have always dreamed of seeing i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie and it does it quite well the characters are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do the only character that seems a little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does there are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects the special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children also the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someones head being blown off however some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including a menage a troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however i tend to disagree what were the alien films about and if an alien species ever did come to earth and their sole purpose was to destroy us wouldnt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store i didnt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with i just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of film it is a vast improvement over the first film at least the acting is the key element to this film if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens okay so it isnt that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in a cage however she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and shes quite fun to just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film michael madsen is soso but he isnt annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell has a small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor as i say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the film a more downtoearth feel and of course justin lazard lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but i think he is effective sure he is wooden but isnt that what his character is like the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due to the couples acting species ii is rated r for strong sexuality scifi violencegore and language this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives hell i dont even know if i will what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year i probably wont see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series medak has also mastered the wonderful jump moments and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film scream still has the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and a surehanded director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining 
plot this movie takes place over one day its a rookie cops narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran the rookie doesnt know much about street justice so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the real world how even cops like themselves have to bend the rules and break the law every now and then in order to catch the really bad guys critique a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board some ups some downs and a thrilling ending despite a couple of small flaws i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place the film gets right into the dirty side of well the dirt on the streets and proceeds to teach the rookie cop and us the audience how things really work down there of course were receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time but the things he seems to be doing arent exactly on the upandup either and therein lies the fun of the film do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones well as the film moves along were given two points of view in respect to this predicament and to me both sides made sense at some point or another and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that the director who builds the film up wonderfully with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades hawke first off because he rarely plays these commercial roles but does so perfectly here with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top and denzel well what can you say about mr washington that hasnt already been said before he comes through as per his usual highlevel style here and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent of which i personally would like to see more hes nice hes not so nice hes smart hes not so smart hes caring and hes a dog all the way the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point okay we get it you have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people move on and this one really major coincidence which involved a bathtub that saved the day for one character but seemed a little too convenient for my taste i also never really understood how washingtons character got out of a certain dire predicament only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene but obviously these small flaws didnt taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama a film that gets you right into the streets into the nooks and the crannies and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the daytoday drug busts see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry onscreen and see it if you like holding on to your seathandles real tight during a movie in fact see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gangbangers alone dang now thats intense wheres joblo coming from the corruptor 710 crimson tide 910 l a confidential 10 lethal weapon 810 requiem for a dream 810 seven 1010 shaft 710 traffic 810 
a thriller set in modern day seattle that marked marky marks migration from the good vibrations and calvin klein undie ad guy to mark wahlberg thespianatlarge and a mighty good one at that plot boy wahlberg meets girl witherspoon boy likes girl girl likes boy boy and girl begin dating parents of girl arent crazy about the boy girl steps to boys defense family problems occur girl learns more about the boy boy goes nuts fun ensues critique ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love well if you ever have then this film is definitely for you it isnt the most original premise in the world but it is handled pretty well here and pretty quickly for that matter a speedy 90 minutes i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg of boogie nights infamy 7 510 he completely captured all the goodness and badness of the main character of this film and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience as best villain at the 1997 mtv movie awards the soundtrack is also very effective in this setting and of course the slutty performance by alyssa milano is something we could all indulge in look for the nice bikini and butt shots if youre into that kind of thing that is i didnt much care for the fatherdavid relationship which seemed to be a little too contrived but for the most part i was really into this movie then again daddy dearest did have one of the coolest lines in the movie when his wife is asking him what the big deal was about his daughter dating david his reply the big deal is that the guy gives me the creeps and the girl is my daughter good point all in all the movie kicked some fun ass mindless as it was and effectively demonstrated every parents worst nightmare mind you i still cant tell if reese witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag but hey life goes on and on a personal note we finally decided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual and let me tell you all it was a flaming success another firm recommendation by joe schmoe little known facts director james foley was the man responsible for the critically acclaimed glengarry glenross 810 back in 1992 at close range 7 510 in 1986 and even directed an episode of twin peaks in 1990 mark wahlberg stands 5 9 is born in massachusetts dropped out of highschool later got his ged and was convicted of several minor felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of marky mark and the funky bunch his brother is donnie wahlberg of new kids on the block fame he is also testing the waters on the acting front 
wow what a movie its everything a movie can be funny dramatic interesting weird funny weird and strikingly original yep that pretty much describes this movie it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest funniest most original movies i have ever seen it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often besides being one of the best films of the year being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever period then again there are so many good movies that one cannot pick an all time favorite john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job in search of a job his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely unnoticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of craig finds a job as a file at the 7 floor of a business building you have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight the 7 floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 he is hired by his 105 year old boss orsen bean to be a filer in his office he discovers a little door to which was boarded up and hidden to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovichs mind fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike he returns to tell his coworker maxine catherine keener that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovichs mind she doesnt believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns that we dont know what really happened john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the worlds most prettiest women is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage to the master himself the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever spike jonze three kings makes his fabulous directing debut and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thoughtprovoking the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heartwarming the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles from cameron diazs appearence to john malkovichs explorations i laughed very hard and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets the funniest there isnt a slow point in the movie or an overused idea there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original inventie witty and smart movie ive seen in a long time i found myself amazed by everything the direction acting writing and the whole idea of the movie by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesnt want to make movies like this anymore or why they dont all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out this was a surprise hit as was american beauty being john malkovich is in the top 5 movies of the year and in the top 10 best films ever made it has something that no other movies playing now has in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now i highly recommend being john malkovich and have no doubts you will be disappointed 
richard gere can be a commanding actor but hes not always in great films everything comes together here gere is a big time chicago defense attorney who takes on a seemingly unwinable case in hopes of even more publicity it doesnt go exactly as he expects geres client aaron edward norton is a shy stuttering tennessee boy who is accused of brutally murdering and mutilating a catholic archbishop the evidence is stacked against him he was caught running from the scene covered in the bishops blood his bloody footprints are all over the murder scene he has a relationship with the priest gere talks to the boy believes that he is actually innocent and sets about finding the real killer despite the lawyers proclamations that he doesnt care about the guilt of his clients and that the real thrill is gambling with peoples lives he becomes involved with aaron and is determined to free him lots of complications and twists the prosecuting attorney is geres former coworker and lover they both work each others motives to their legal advantages and it gets messy her boss had major economic dealings with the archbishop that went sour and seems to have crime connections aaron gets weirder and weirder as the trial goes on geres case is falling apart and he is faced with about a dozen ethical dilemmas gere is exceptional as the welldressed reserved counselor but just once i wanted to see him kick back and come out of his suit persona even when he loses it you dont see very far inside nortons aaron is convincing he comes across as the backwoods kid misplaced in the big city the supporting cast does a fine job of holding together the story as with most of the effective courtroom dramas the cinematography is crisp and rich the story will keep you on the edge of your seat nothing is what it seems 
glorystarring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freemanis the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war broderick plays robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle shaw the son of welltodo abolitionists hailed from boston high society the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory as the film begins in 1862 shaw is a captain in the northern forces like private eriksson michael j fox in casualties of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the warthat is until his company is attacked by enemy forces shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery the film periodically jumps between shaws point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the films intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave it makes your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings a tear rolls down washingtons cheekand will probably run down your cheek as well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasnt deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores freeman is as usual a strong presence even in a small supporting role he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers colonel shaw recognizes freemans leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles a free black who is one of shaws close childhood friends searles is educated and refined like a white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them to racism and discrimination they are paid only 10 a month whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen and for a long time they have to go without shoes guns or uniforms to make matters worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it means threatening a general with blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment unfortunately however brodericks uneven performance is in many respects the weak link in the movie in an effort to look more mature broderick sports a mustache and a goatee and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced the film places too much weight on brodericks character and not enough on the black soldiers who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head the film for the most part leaves the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying its just that director edward zwick the cocreator of thirtysomething films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers the movie depicts some of but not enough of their customs and rituals in one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration a couple of the movies most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe disbelief and pride the regiments greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner like any war film glory has its share of gloom and despair but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say or more precisely what they do not say blacks played a critically important role in the norths victory over the southforever changing the evolution of america 
steven spielbergs second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film spielberg ever the student on film has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest and most powerful entries he also managed to cast this eras greatest answer to jimmy stewart tom hanks who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle for about 160 out of its 170 minutes saving private ryan is flawless literally the plot is simple enough after the epic dday invasion whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular capt john miller hanks and his team are forced to search for a pvt james ryan damon whose brothers have all died in battle once they find him they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home accompanying miller are his crew played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational barry pepper adam goldberg vin diesel giovanni ribisi davies and burns are the team sent to find one man and bring him home the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary literally there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the films first 20 minutes spielberg films almost the entire movie without music leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion and they do to perfection the sequences in france all of them beginning with the battle and ending with the battle are fabulous especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides trying to save private ryan there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences this is what coppola was looking for in apocalypse now but couldnt create the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world with his comic timing dramatic flair his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears hanks is this countrys finest actor and he proves it here however spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film the sequence involving army chiefofstafff george marshall and mrs ryan is decent but doesnt hold up to the rest of the film relying on wartime cliches to power it but that is forgivable what isnt is the bookends of the film the cemetary sequences the first one is quite good a decent introduction into the lives of these men the last sequence is atrocious the forced emotion accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film these flaws are what downgrade ryan from the greatest film of our era to the greatest war film of our era spielberg should have trusted his own material and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie to end his masterpiece right there the use of the flag though patriotic is in contrast to the movies theme the power of the bulk of the film however is astonishing spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art that persists even after first viewing of the film is extraordinary this is the film of the year 
truman trueman burbank is the perfect name for jim carreys character in this film president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide in spite of or was it because of his stature truman also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or was the center of tvs world the world where our protagonist lives combine all these names and concepts into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman leads the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian when the radio comes back to normal the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guards grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it gets even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge its best not to think about it she says trying vainly to change trumans memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that trumans life is the subject of a television program his actions are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the allseeing creator of trumans world does his best to keep him unaware and happy its sort of like westworld told from the robots point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaurs point of view we root for the captive of the cageworld our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writerdirector of gattaca introduces some interesting questions such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake although these questions came to mind i dont think the film itself asked them it certainly didnt address them or try to answer them i was particularly disappointed that the film didnt deal more with the trauma of learning ones life is a tv show carreys performance at the end showed a smidgen of trumans pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the films pacing earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didnt see it that way perhaps its not fair to criticize a movie for what it isnt but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here but on its own terms the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is wellchosen and scored the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music when trumans world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie ends the score sounds more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates trumans scenes of suspicion and awakening glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story was brisk there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title cards a few interviews and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of trumans idyllic life before it falls apart because it wasnt necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner theres also no point in the movie where the plot slows down its a quick straight shot to the movies end in terms of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccols gattaca both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas neither film clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless i look forward to niccols next film whatever it may be
