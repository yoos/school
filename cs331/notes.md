<!-- Try incorporating this into OSUAR nav code -->
Percept sequence: complete history of everything agent has ever perceived
Agent function (or policy): map per seq to actions.
Review properties of environments
4 types of agents (plus learning agent) -- names are good! Identify in our nav system, since we have all five.

# 04/05: Uninformed Search
Review tree search.
Use heap for priority queue.
Iterative deepening combines best of BFS and DFS.

# 04/08: Uninformed Search (continued)
Avoid repeated states by referring to a closed list, implemented in a hash table.
Graph search implements some search algorithm to avoid loops.

# 04/08 (Informed Search)
Admissible heuristic

HW: Try graph search instead of tree search, since it will detect cycles. Refer to pseudocode in book.
HW: Increment counter right after removing fringe node and before actually expanding.
