# W2T
  * Structure-Functionalism
    - _Foo has been around a while; it must serve some purpose. What is it?
      I.e., poverty provides cheap labor._
    - People: Durkheim; Merton
    - Society: interrelated parts
    - Cause: rapid social change
    - Solutions: repair weak institutions
    - Other: manifest and latent functions
  * Social Conflict
    - _Who benefits?_
    - People: Marx
    - Society: power struggles over scarce resources; social change is
      inevitable
    - Cause: Inequality; Oppression and exploitation; competition between
      groups (haves/haves not)
    - Solutions: create equitable system for the distribution of resources
  * Symbolic Interactionism
    - _How do we give the world meaning? How do we treat the world differently
      as a result? I.e., labeling young people as "delinquent" vs. "at-risk"_
    - Society: roles; social order constructed through interaction; shared
      meaning
    - Cause: labeling; stigma
    - Solution: reduce impact of labeling; alter definitions
  * Sociological Methods/Tools
    - Research: systematic examination of empirical data

# W2R
  * *Poverty*: lack of resources necessary for material well-being: food, water,
    housing, land, health care.
  * *Absolute poverty*: lack of resources that leads to hunger and physical
    deprivation.
  * *Relative poverty*: deficiency in material and economic resources compared
    with some other population.
  * *Wealth* vs *Household Income*: some have enough to invest; others live
    paycheck to paycheck.
  * U.S. Measures of Poverty
    - In 1964, the Social Security Administration devised a poverty index based
      on data that indicated that families spent about 1/3 of income on food.
    - Official poverty level was set by multiplying food costs by 3.
    - Since then, poverty level has been updated annually for inflation but is
      the same across the continental U.S.
  * Rates can decrease even if numbers increase.
    - E.g., number of people on welfare may decrease, but poverty is
      increasing.
  * Unemployment rates may not reflect the number of people underemployed
    (working part-time). See *TANF*.

# W3T
  * Increasing income inequality: money makes more money.
    - Investments in retirement accounts, 401k's, stocks
  * Education is one of the best insurance policies against poverty.
    - Children from poor families score lower on tests of cognitive skill.
      * Consider relationship between income, 8th grade math scores, and
        percentage who complete bachelor's degree.
    - Poor children often go to inferior schools
    - Poor parents have fewer resources to provide educational experiences for
      their children.
      * Electronics, Internet access, etc. are luxuries.
      * No extracurricular activities
  * Culture of poverty: institutional breakdowns create a culture of poverty
    whereby the poor develop norms, values, beliefs, and self-concepts that
    contribute to their own plight.
    - If school not valued, children may feel discouraged from studying and
      attending school.
    - Burglary, drugs, prostitution
  * Characterized by female-centered households (i.e., women working multiple
    jobs, single mothers, feminization of poverty), and emphasis on
    gratification in the present rather than in the future and a lack of
    participation in social institutions.
  * Intergenerational poverty
  * Poverty cycle
    1. Children in poor families live in poor neighborhoods.
    2. The children attend inferior schools, drop out, or have low academic
       achievement.
    3. As adults, they have few legitimate opportunities, are unemployed, or
       earn low wages.
    4. Develop a sense of hopelessness, failure; remain in poor neighborhoods
       and have children.
      - Having little, children become valuable in themselves, even a status
        symbol.
      - How do we break the cycle?
  * _Homelessness and the working poor_
    - Homelessness is the visible form of poverty; however, the most common
      form is the working poor
    - "Up to 70% of the people who are living in poverty in Oregon are 'working
      poor.' That is, these people don't earn enough to leave the ranks of the
      poor."
    - The "hidden homeless" (i.e., staying at friend's house)
  * _Age and poverty_: Children are more likely than adults to live in poverty.
    35.5% of the U.S. poor population are children.
  * Theories:
    - Structural-Functionalist: poverty results from institutional breakdown:
      * Economic institutions that fail to provide sufficient jobs and pay
      * Educational institutions that fail to equip members of society with the
        skills they need for employment
      * Family institutions that do not provide help
      * Government institutions that do not provide sufficient public support
      * Economic inequality within a society can be beneficial for society, as
        a system of unequal pay motivates a people to achieve higher levels of
        training and education and to take on jobs that are more important and
        difficult by offering higher rewards for higher achievements.
    - Conflict:
      * Economic inequality results from bourgeoisie (upper class) exploiting
        proletariat (working class).
        - Working class too busy to unite and rise to challenge the system.
      * Corporations and the wealthy buy political influence.
        - E.g., little legislation exists that reward businesses for creating
          jobs here instead of overseas.
      * Free-market reform policies benefit wealthy corporations and investors
        but increase poverty.
      * Wealthfare: laws and policies that benefit corporations and the wealthy

# W3R
  * Symbolic Interactionist Perspective
    - Persons labeled "poor" are stigmatized as lazy, irresponsible, lacking in
      motivation, ability, and morals.
    - Wealthy persons are viewed as capable, hard-working, motivated, deserving
      of wealth (even if inherited).
    - "Working poor" - how does this new label affect how we treat these people
      and how we make policies?
  * Inequality
    - Inequality: puts some groups at a competitive disadvantage and affects
      their life chances.
    - Socialization: the way in which we learn how to be part of and interact
      in society - language and culture
    - Rather than focus on the individual, sociologists focus on social forces
      that contribute to prejudice.
    - Concepts:
      * Prejudice = attitude
      * Discrimination = behavior
  * Race and Ethnic Inequality
    - Race = biological group (more of a social category)
    - Ethnicity = shared common history and cultural heritage
    - Race is socially created! This means the actual meaning or race lies not
      in people's physical characteristics but in the historical treatment of
      different groups and the significance. People learn to perceive others
      according to whatever racial classification system exists in their
      culture.
  * Learning prejudice through socialization
    - Begins in early childhood, involves all our institutions
  * Employment discrimination
    - Despite laws against it, discrimination (age, gender, race) against
      minorities occurs today in all phases of the employment process, from
      recruitment to interview, job offer, salary, promotion, and firing
      decisions.
    - Contributes to higher rates of unemployment and lower incomes of blacks
      and Hispanics compared with those of whites.
    - Know trends/impacts:
      * Education
      * Employment and income
        - Lower lifetime earnings
        - Higher unemployment rates
        - Lower-paying jobs (underemployment)
      * Politics
        - Historically discouraged from political involvement
        - Underrepresented in federal legislature
      * Hate crime victimization
      * Health and quality of life
      * Myths and realities of affirmative action
      * Structural functionalist perspective
        - Racial social inequality was functional for some groups.
        - Racial and ethnic inequality aggravates social problems and is
          dysfunctional for society.
      * Conflict perspective
        - Economic competition creates and maintains racial and ethnic group
          tensions.
        - Minorities who are disproportionately unemployed serve interests of
          business owners by keeping wages low.
      * Symbolic interactionist perspective
        - Meanings and definitions contribute to subordinate status of racial
          and ethnic groups (how do we break down labels and stereotypes?).
        - Negative terms associated with "black" (black knight is evil, white
          knight is good)
        - Negative stereotypes of racial and ethnic groups lead to
          self-fulfilling prophecy.

# W5T
  * __Work__
  * The Second Shift: According to Hochschild, women are expected to work
    "second shifts" by having gainful outside employment as well as performing
    household chores and childcare once they arrive home after a day's work
  * Related social problems:
    - Feminization of poverty
      * Heads of households with dependent children
      * Those over age 65 who have outlived their spouses
    - Retirement/aging
  * Structural Functionalist Perspective
    - Pre-industrial society required division of labor based on gender.
      * Women nursed and cared for children
      * Men responsible for material needs
    - Industrialization made traditional division of labor less functional,
      belief system remains.
  * Conflict Perspective
    - Continued domination by males requires a belief system that supports
      gender inequality.
    - Two beliefs:
      * Women are inferior outside the home
      * Women are more valuable in the home
  * Symbolic Interactionist Perspective
    - Gender and gender roles learned through socialization process
      * Women socialized into expressive roles
      * Men socialized into instrumental roles

  * __Age__
  * Age is a social variable.
    - Determines one's life experiences
    - Defines roles/expectations of behavior
    - Influences which social groups you belong to
    - Defines legal status
  * Three demographic changes:
    - 76 million baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are getting older:
      the 'graying of America'
    - Life expectancy has increased
    - Decreasing birth rates mean fewer children and a higher percentage of
      dependents
  * Dependency ratio: Number of societal members that are under 18 or over 64
    compared with number of people who are between 18 and 64.
  * Sandwich generation: Generation that has the responsibility of
    simultaneously caring for their children and their aging parents.
  * Caregiving: Informal and unpaid care provided to a dependent person by
    family members, other relatives, or friend.
  * The Conversation: Culture of Silence
    - Parents don't want to worry their children
    - Children are reluctant to bring up a subject so intimate; some worry
      their parents will think they're expecting or waiting for them to die.
    - Doctors are "in charge" and will make the right decisions

# W6T
  * __Ageism__
  * Belief (prejudice) that age is associated with certain psychological,
    behavioral, and/or intellectual traits.
  * Results in differential treatment (discrimination) based on perceived
    age.
  * Child labor
    - Pornography, prostitution
  * Homelessness/poverty
    - Younger people poorest age group in U.S.
  * Health care
    - Eating disorders
    - Suicide
    - Mental health

# W6R
  * __Physical and Mental Health and Healthcare__
  * Medical Sociology: specializes in research on the healthcare system and its
    impacts on the public
  * Key concepts:
    - Morbidity: acute or chronic illness
    - Mortality: death, often in terms of rates
    - Maternal mortality rate: leading cause of death and disability for women
      ages 15-49 in developing countries
  * Escalating medical costs
    - Expensive medical technologies
    - Increased longevity
    - Prescription drugs
    - Insurance
  * Strategies vs obesity
    - Restrictions and advertisements
    - Public education
    - School nutrition and physical activity programs
    - Interventions to treat obesity
  * Mental illness
    - "Hidden epidemic" because the shame and embarrassment associated with
      mental problems discourage people from acknowledging and talking about
      them.
    - Untreated disorders can lead to:
      * Poor educational achievement
      * Lost productivity
      * Unsuccessful relationships
      * Significant distress
      * Violence and abuse
      * Incarceration
      * Poverty
    - Scientific and medical explanations focus on:
      * Genetics/neurological conditions
      * Social and environmental influences
  * Attitudes and values
    - Value of the "work ethic" - taking time off is slacking off?
    - Value placed on seeking help (especially mental health, also gender and
      social class related)
    - Organizational values (military examples)
  * Social factors and lifestyle behaviors
    - Poverty is associated with malnutrition, indoor air pollution, hazardous
      working conditions, lack of access to medical care, and unsafe water and
      sanitation.
    - Lower social class:
      * More physical health problems
      * Less knowledge and less likely to use healthcare options
      * Less knowledge about good health
      * Less likely to have preventatative care, health insurance, and services
        in their neighborhood
  * Medicare funded by federal government. Does not cover long-term nursing
    home care, dental care, eyeglasses, and other services. Enrollees must also
    pay a monthly premium and copayment for services.
  * Medicaid covers the poor, funded by the federal and state governments.
    - Does not cover everyone

# W7R

## U.S. Health Care Reform
  * U.S. is only country in industrialized world that does not guarantee health
    care to citizens.
  * Cost savings
  * Current law
    - Coverage of children with pre-existing illnesses
    - Eliminates dropping of people who get sick
    - Allows parents to keep children on policy until age 26
    - Allows free preventative care (e.g., flu shots, examinations)
    - Removes lifetime limits
    - Tax credits for small business
    - By 2014, businesses indicate their coverage
    - By 2014, require health insurance (if can't afford, then subsidize)

## Crime and Social Control
  * Crime
    - Principles guiding our laws:
      * Punishment/deterrence (specific/general)
      * Protect society
      * Rehabilitation
      * Retribution
    - What is crime?
      * An act, or the omission of an act, that is a violation of a federal,
        state, or local criminal law for which the state can apply sanctions.
      * Measured by official statistics, victimization surveys, and self-report
        offender surveys.
    - Types of crime
      * Index offenses (UCR (uniform crime report) data/official stats)
      * Vice
      * Organized
      * White-collar
      * Computer
      * Juvenile delinquency
    - Official statistics
      * FBI
      * Shortcomings
        - Many crimes not reported
        - Some not recorded by police
        - Some rates exaggerated
        - Missing categories
        - Technology and crime
    - Types of White Collar Crime
      * By workers (embezzlement, time loss, computer, credit card misuse)
      * Against government (tax evasion)
      * Against individual (mail order, marketing scams, investment schemes,
        identity  theft)
      * By businesses (copyright infringement, spying, kickbacks, bribes)
    - Impacts of White Collar Crime
      * Increases cost of doing business (costs passed on/externalized)
      * Lost tax revenue due to undeclared income
      * Cost people jobs, savings
      * Unsafe products lead to health problems, lost wages
      * FBI estimates upwards of $300 billion/year

# W8T
  * Types of crime (cont.)
  * Vice crimes (victimless?)
    - Pornography
    - Gambling
    - Prostitution
  * Demographics and crime
    - Trends:
      * Gender (e.g., female gangs)
      * Age
      * Race, social class
    - Victims, for example, are disproportionately young, lower-class, minority
      males from urban areas.
    - Race is a factor in who gets arrested. Minorities are disproportionately
      represented in official statistics.
    - Trends/myths from text (esp. violent offenses and property offenses)
      * In most murders, the victim is the same race as the offender
      * Rape is intraracial
      * Most rapes are acquaintance rapes, occurring most often but reported
        least. Women hesitate to report the crime out of fear of not being
        believed. The increased use of rape drugs, such as Rohypnol, may lower
        reporting levels even further.

# W8R
  * (Missed class, talked about education.)

# W9T

## Education
  * Bullying: an imbalance of power that exists over a long period of time in
    which the more powerful intimidate or belittle others. Can occur in person
    or through technology (cyberbullying).
  * Role of teachers
    - Self-fulfilling prophecy: students can be encouraged to succeed
    - Teacher inadequacies - tenure
    - Teach for America

## Population
  * How many people can the earth support?
  * Depends as much on social, cultural, economic, and political choices as it
    does on constraints imposed by nature.
  * Population momentum: continued population groth as a result of past high
    fertility rates that have resulted in a large number of young women who are
    currently entering their childbearing years.
  * Despite the below-replacement fertility rates (2.1) in more developed
    regions, population in these regions is expected to continue to grow until
    2030.
  * Slowing population growth
    - Improve status of women beyond wife/mother
    - Educated women are more likely to use contraception and limit their
      children
    - Availability of health care, family planning
    - High levels of female labor force participation and higher wages for
      women are associated with smaller family size.
    - Usage of contraception among married women ages 15 to 49:
      * World: 55%
      * U.S.: 73%
      * Least developed countries: 23%

# W10T
  * Population is linked to other social problems such as poverty and access to
    health care.
  * Population is the world's top environmental problem, followed closely by
    climate change and the need to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy
    sources.
  * However, countries with the largest populations do not necessarily have the
    largest impact on the environment. The very poor are not likely to be
    thinking of climate change when deciding to cut down a forest.

## Environmental Problems
  * Bioinvasion: invasive species
  * Industrialized countries consume more energy and natural resources and
    contribute more pollution to the environment than poor countries.
  * Sources of environmental problems are rooted in both aspects of our social
    structure: culture and social institutions - they reflect our Dominant
    Social Paradigms (belief systems):
    - Individualism
    - Consumerism/materialism
    - Technological solutions

# W10R

## Environmental Injustice
  * Tendency for socially and politically marginalized groups to bear the brunt
    of environmental ills. (E.g., cancer alley - neighborhood around
    petrochemical plants in Louisiana/Texas with higher-than-average cancer
    rates)
  * Many sitings are a result of businesses/government taking the paths of
    least resistance when determining a place for their next facility.
    - Economically poor: cheap labor, cheap land; bad deal over no deal
    - Politically powerless: lack representation/organization, renters vs
      owners, voter behavior, lack regulation/enforcement
    - Limited mobility
  * Structural-Functionalist Perspective
    - Emphasizes interdependence between human beings and natural environment.
    - Raises awareness of unintended negative consequences of social actions.
    - Focuses on how changes in one aspect of the social system affect other
      aspects of society.
    - By 2020, an estimated 50 million people globally will be environmental
      refugees - individuals who have migrated because they can no longer
      secure a livelihood as a result of environmental problems.
  * Conflict Perspective
    - Focuses on how wealth power, and the pursuit of profit underlie many
      environmental problems.
  * Symbolic Interactionist Perspective
    - Focuses on how meanings, labels, and definitions learned through
      interaction and through the media affect environmental problems.
    - Large corporations and industries commonly use marketing and public
      relations strategies to construct favorable meanings of their corporation
      or industry.
      * Greenwashing

## For the final (from the text)
  * Less emphasis on globalization
  * General trends of natural resource impacts (e.g., sustainability, air
    pollution, desertification, deforestation, greenwashing, energy use, etc.)
